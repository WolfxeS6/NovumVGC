# Leader description starts here
POLITICS_saddam_desc:0 "Saddam Hussein was born on April of 1937, he is Iraq's 5th President and by far one of the nation's most infamous leaders. Most infamously, he is responsible for starting the Iran-Iraq war, which lasted from 1980 to '88. He also started and lost the Gulf War, which saw Iraq face off against a coalition of 42 different countries. Now, his rule has shaken. §RThe US, with its ''Iraq Liberation Act'' now makes the toppling of Saddam a mission in US foreign policy§!. Meanwhile, the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings shows that Saddam isn't as popular as he once was.\n\nWith the West aiming to topple Saddam, it's only a matter of time before Saddam faces the Goliath once more..."
POLITICS_qusay_desc:0 "Qusay Hussein was born on the 17th of May, 1966. His career, although unremarkable in comparison to his older brother Uday Hussein, he does resemble a much more calmer and more cunning individual. He is thought to be responsible for the crushing the revolt of 1991, as well as the destruction of the Iraqi southern marshes. He is a very cunning individual, and perhaps smarter than both his father and older brother. Now in leadership of Iraq, Qusay now toes the line between reforming the Ba'ath party and following the path of his father."
POLITICS_uday_hussein:0 "Uday Hussein, born on the 18th of July 1964 resembles the most stereotypical dictator. Ruthless and intimidating to his rivals and friends, he is rumored to harshly punish Iraqi Olympic athletes whenever they lost a match. One of his classmates said about him; ''He was really smart, probably smarter than his father—but he was crazy.'' He is also a well known hedonist, well known in Iraq for his outlandish parties even if there was no reason to celebrate. Although not strictly a Jucheist, his ultra-violent tendencies and the nominally socialist government of the Ba'athist Party does tend to lean Jucheist."
