 chechnya.1.t:0 "Akhmad Kadyrov offers his support against [CHE.GetNameDef]"
 chechnya.1.d:0 "Akhmad Kadyrov, leader of Chechnya's pro-Russian faction, has requested a secret meeting with our officials. In a tense exchange, he offers his support in the ongoing war against Chechen separatists in return for a significant price: the right to rule Chechnya as its new leader under Russia’s protection. Kadyrov’s terms would give us an ally on the ground, but at the cost of granting him power in the region. While Kadyrov’s offer could end the insurgency in Chechnya, we cannot ignore the risks of empowering him as a leader under our control. Should we accept his terms, it may solidify our influence over the region—but it could also spark further unrest among those who resist our presence."
