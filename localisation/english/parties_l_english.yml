Young Korean democratic activists have established the ideology through the many debates that fighting against Korea's dictatorship requires voluntary power from Korea, not the help of the United States.\n\nIn this situation, in the 1980s, North Korea's Juche was introduced to South Korean university students, which shocked South Korean intellectuals. Juche, who extremely transformed Marx-Leninism, made young Korean intellectuals know that there was an 'idea unique to Koreans' that Westerners did not create. Many student activists accepted Juche as an ideology to fight military dictatorship, and built the idea that North Korea and South Korea, the two 'Korean races' should unite to fight fascism and the imperialist of the United States."
