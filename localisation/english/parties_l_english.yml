Juche, who extremely transformed Marx-Leninism, made young Korean intellectuals know that there was an 'idea unique to Koreans' that Westerners did not create.

The NEP maintained a communist system, but mixed the market economy. Chinese politicians, including Deng Xiaoping, believe that the NEP of the Soviet Union was the right way to create a completed communist state.\n\nSocialism with Chinese characteristics mixed the market economy of the NEP so that China could maintain its system after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, some traditionalist communists criticize that they have become too different from Chinese communism during the Maoist period and China have only become another capitalist country."

CPRF devided left forces of Russia into 2 parties, which also influenced the Yeltsin victory in 1993 Moscow events (known in Russia as "Black October").\n\nBy 1995 RCWP has lost much its popular support and CPRF started to become leading Russian left party. Despite American help to Yeltsin regime CPRF won the 1996 elections, but pro-Yeltsin electoral frauds brought victory to previous president. As a parlamentary moderate party CPRF didnt do anything to change the election results.\n\nParty`s programm aims to establish a social state in Russia withput much interruption into business and oligarph spheres.\n\n§!"

In 1990`s this party was quite influental and could organize rallies with hundreds of thousands participants. However, with time party lost much of people`s support.\n\nDuring the last party congress in 2000 it was decided that workers should have majority in all party departments and majority of decisive votes in all party congresses. This decision can cause a split inside the party as there are party members who dont want to share their power with workers.\n\n§!"
