 BOS_bosnias_economic_future: "Bosnia's Economic Future"
 BOS_bosnias_economic_future_desc: "The Bosnian War ended nearly 5 years ago. So far, we have made significant progress in rebuilding the country. With our entry into the new millenium, we should decide how to approach our economical growth in the future."
 BOS_open_bosnia_to_international_investments: "Open Bosnia to Foreign Investments"
 BOS_open_bosnia_to_international_investments_desc: "In order to build our economy and reach new heights we will have to embrace cooperation with both international and regional partners such as the European Union, Russia, China and the Gulf States. This will bring us new funds neccesary to build new infrastructure and factories."
 BOS_chinese_infrastructure_experts: "Invite Chinese Infrastructure Experts"
 BOS_chinese_infrastructure_experts_desc: "As a part of its New Silk Road Project, China has become a master of building infrastructure in developing countries. They have specialists whom we can invite to improve our own infrastructure here at home. The only negative is that this will increase their influence in the country."
 BOS_seek_european_investments: "Seek European Investments"
 BOS_seek_european_investments_desc: "Bosnia is geographically a part of Europe. One of the most powerful economic powerhouses on the continent is undeniably the European Union. We should seek investments from its leading countries such as France and especially Germany. By doing this, we can boost our own industrial growth while growing closer to the EU."
 BOS_invite_arab_gulf_investors: "Invite Arab Gulf Investors"
 BOS_invite_arab_gulf_investors_desc: "Our muslim brothers in the Arab Gulf, predominantly in the UAE, Saudi and Qatar would surely be interested in investing in our economy. This would provide them a nice amount of influence but also boost our own economy significantly, connecting it with new eastern partners. The EU might not be as fond of this though."
 BOS_russian_arms_factories: "Russian Arms Factories in Bosnia"
 BOS_russian_arms_factories_desc: "Russia is our natural ally. The West does not really care for us. We will allow them to establish arms factories in Bosnia which will bring them the benefit of further influence and their weapon market expanding, and it would give us an easy way of getting more weapons for our own protection. It is a Win-Win Situation."
 BOS_question_of_the_immigrants: "Question of the Refugees"
 BOS_question_of_the_immigrants_desc: "Due to rising instability across the Middle East and Northern Africa, many refugees are seeking entry into Bosnia, mostly to move further into EU territories like Germany and France. Now we have to make a decision on what our stance towards their immigration should be."
 bosnia.1.t: "Question of the Refugees"
 bosnia.1.d: "As a result of the rising instability and civil wars in the East and in the South, there are many refugees going through Bosnia mostly into EU countries like France and Germany seeking a better life. Now, we have two choices at hand. We can either stricten border controls to protect ourselves against crime or utilize the labor of the refugees and immigrate them into our great country."
 bosnia.1.o1: "We will integrate our brothers"
 bosnia.1.o2: "Don't let any criminals in"
 bosnia.2.t: "Bosnia wants to join our Faction"
 bosnia.2.d: "The government in Sarajevo has requested to join our faction and enter into our sphere of friendship. Should we accept their offer or do we reject them? We have to decide quickly, otherwise they might change their mind on this."
 bosnia.2.o1: "Let them in, why not?"
 bosnia.2.o2: "No, we shouldn't accept"
 bosnia.3.t: "Rejected Faction Application"
 bosnia.3.d: "The country we have asked for faction membership has sadly rejected our offer. This is a great misfortune and will hurt our chances to get allies on the world stage. We should either look for a new ally or keep independent outside of factions. But now we know that the country who we perceived as friendly actually dislikes us."
 bosnia.3.o1: "Now that's not what we wanted!"
 bosnia.4.t: "New Socialist Economic Policy"
 bosnia.4.d: "Now that we have re-established socialist control over the Bosnian realm, we should choose a new economic policy which will help us implement marxism in our country. We have 3 options. First, we can continue with the Market Socialist policies of our old great leader Josip Broz Tito. Then, we could go for a more Soviet style of economics. The third option would be taking inspiration from our new Chinese friends and implementing their new reformed form of socialism. We should decide quickly."
 bosnia.4.o1: "Continue Tito's Legacy"
 bosnia.4.o2: "A Soviet Yugoslavia"
 bosnia.4.o3: "Take advice from Peking"
 bosnia.5.t: "Memories of the Bosnian War"
 bosnia.5.d: "5 years ago, the bloodiest war in Europe since World War 2 came to an end. We came out somewhat victorious, as Bosnia's sovereignity was preserved and the traitors of Republika Srpska and Herzegbosna were annexed back into the nation. However, they still have their autonomy and are actively blocking the institutions of the country. Maybe we should have gone further, maybe the Dayton Agreement was a mistake? Or should we consider the war as a Great Victory over the Aggresors?"
 bosnia.5.o1: "Remember it as a Victory"
 bosnia.5.o2: "The Dayton Agreement was a Disgrace"
 bosnia.6.t: "The Two Entities"
 bosnia.6.d: "Bosnia, in accordance to the Dayton Agreement of 1995, is split into 2 semi-autonomous entities. One is the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which Croats and Bosniaks live and the other one is Republika Srpska, a majority serb region. This system, while keeping all 3 sides satisfied to some degree, really makes our institutions ineffective and is proving hell for our administration as especially Republika Srpska always seeks to gain more autonomy and separate."
 bosnia.6.o1: "The current status quo serves us well"
 bosnia.6.o2: "This system is holding us back"
 bosnia.7.t: "Alija's Retirement"
 bosnia.7.d: "Alija Izetbegovic can be called the father of Modern Bosnia. He established Bosnia in the modern age as we know it. Without him, maybe Bosnia wouldn't have ever achieved statehood again. But through his leadership, we have finally gained Bosnia back its freedom and we are going to reclaim its old legacy too. Unfortunately, Alija has goten old and sick. In order to keep his health condition good, he will leave his role as the leader of the SDA and leave it to someone else."
 bosnia.7.o1: "Goodbye, old friend"
 bosnia.8.t: "Campaign 2002"
 bosnia.8.d: "The elections of 2002 are approaching, which could be a decisive one as the SBiH is gaining popularity and threatening to end SDA rule. On top of that, in Serbian politics Milorad Dodik's new party SNSD is threatening the SDS' place in the Three-Member Presidency. On the Croatian Front, the HDZ is relatively safe. Should we power the SDA, its opposition, or emphasize separatist ethnonationalist rhetoric against the country?"
 bosnia.8.o1: "The SDA has served us well"
 bosnia.8.o2: "SBiH or nothing"
 bosnia.8.o3: "Bosnia is a failed state"
 bosnia.9.o1: "We must enter the Western Bloc soon"
 bosnia.9.o2: "Slow down guys, InshAllah the day will come"
 bosnia.9.o3: "The West is a failed society"
 bosnia.9.t: "The Euroatlantic Integrations"
 bosnia.9.d: "The Euroatlantic Integration is a widely used term to describe the entry of the Western Balkans into western blocks like NATO and the EU. We should discuss in our society whether we should try to make an actual plan to embrace the integrations, whether we can slow down like now, or whether we should completely throw off this stupid idea."

 BOS_bosnian_language_integration_programme: "Bosnian Language Integration Programme"
 BOS_bosnian_language_integration_programme_desc: "A genuine problem our policy posseses is that Bosnia is not armed with the tools to integrate all of these Immigrants. We don't have enough books and programmes which explain the language to a foreign populace. If we improve on this, we will truly maximize our gains from immigration."
 BOS_land_mine_problem: "Land Mine Problem"
 BOS_land_mine_problem_desc: "Bosnia has the most landmines in the world. This is currently a massive problem, causing incidents and lowering the safety of our citizens. This has economic consequences too. We will have to deal with it."
 BOS_utilize_immigrant_labor: "Utilize Immigrant Labor"
 BOS_utilize_immigrant_labor_desc: "As our people leave for other countries like Germany we are desperately in the need of a new labor force. We can use the new refugees coming to Bosnia and try to integrate them into society in order to power our economy. How this will go we don't know."
 BOS_stricter_borders: "Implement Stricter Border Controls"
 BOS_stricter_borders_desc: "Our country needs to implement stricter borders. We simply cannot keep up with the amount of refugees coming in. The streets of Sarajevo are filled with illegal immigrants who are high on drugs. This is unfortunately unacceptable, and we are not capable to stop this either. There is only one solution to this problem."
 BOS_cooperate_with_serbian_police: "Cooperate with Serbian Police"
 BOS_cooperate_with_serbian_police_desc: "In order to minimize the costs of our own expanded Border security we should seek to cooperate with our Serbian Neighbor on this matter, which might even help us improve relations for future projects."
 BOS_land_mine_removal: "Finish Land Mine Removal"
 BOS_land_mine_removal_desc: "Bosnia is filled with leftover land mines from the war. This posses a serious economic and security risk. We are actually the first country in the world statistically when it comes to the amount of remaining land mines. We should solve this in a coordinated effort."
 BOS_fund_bhrt: "Fund the BHRT"
 BOS_fund_bhrt_desc: "The good old BHRT should be expanded upon as our national television. We will increase its funding and make it mandatory that it airs on all 3 constitutional languages.

 BOS_revive_communist_ideas: "Revive Communist Ideas"
 BOS_revive_communist_ideas_desc: "In truth, we can clearly see the Collapse of Yugoslavia was the biggest mistake for humanity in the last 10 years. Socialism was great for Bosnia and its end is a tragedy. We should revive Communist ideas in Bosnia and establish a new movement for ourselves"
 BOS_embrace_yugonostalgia: "Embrace Yugonostalgia"
 BOS_embrace_yugonostalgia_desc: "Many of our people are nostalgic for the good times they had in Yugoslavia. In fact, many would like Yugoslavia to return and for the old times of market socialism to be restored across the Balkans. We should utilize this and embrace it as one of our goals: the Restoration of Yugoslavia must be achieved!"
 BOS_socialist_labor_unions: "Convince the Labor Unions"
 BOS_socialist_labor_unions_desc: "There are many workers across Bosnia who are not satisfied with the actions of the current government when it comes to their salary. We should blame capitalism and tell them that only through communism will the worker see the light of prosperity again as in the old days. This will grant us more popularity which we desperately need."
 BOS_found_the_communist_party: "Found the Communist Party"
 BOS_found_the_communist_party_desc: "Now that we have embraced socialist ideals we should officialy establish a new communist party and get into the parliament and win the elections. This is the easiest and most simple way to take charge of the country. In our case, there isn't really a need for a revolution. This should be a rather simple approach with not many consequences."
 BOS_criticize_nato_imperialists: "Criticize NATO Imperialists"
 BOS_criticize_nato_imperialists_desc: "NATO is an imperialist organization which has destroyed Yugoslavia and now seeks to upheave global order by invading the Middle East for the gains of their capitalist Military Industrial Complex.

 BOS_join_china: "Join the Chinese Cause"
 BOS_join_china_desc: "China is the last bastion of actual socialism after the Fall of the Soviet Union. We should join their Shanghai Pact, expanding their influence into Europe. This will benefit our economy and our security."

 BOS_military_exercises_in_bosnia: "Military Exercises in Bosnia"

 BOS_smash_ethnonationalism: "Smash Ethnonationalist Structures"
 BOS_smash_ethnonationalism_desc: "There is no place for any kind of racist nationalism in any future Bosnia or Yugoslavia. It must be finally destroyed. It was the reason Yugoslavia ended and we fell into misfortune in the first place. Let us not allow this to happen again."
 BOS_new_socialist_economic_approach: "New Socialist Economic Approach"
 BOS_new_socialist_economic_approach_desc: "We should choose what kind of communism we want to adopt. Do we go for Tito's Old Market Socialism, a Soviet Style of Economics or China's New Form of Socialism? This will decide our future, really. We have to make a good reasoned decision that defends and supports socialism."
 BOS_fight_inflation: "Fight Inflation"
 BOS_fight_inflation_desc: "We might be at risk of suffering inflation soon in the future, at levels that are unprecented. We will prevent this early on by prioritizing fiscal stability over unsustainable economic growth. This is the true way forward economically."
 BOS_loans_from_imf: "Loans from the IMF"
 BOS_loans_from_imf_desc: "We should take loans from international institutions in order to boost and rebuild our economy after the war. This will destabilize our currency and will not be liked by our somewhat conservative people, but who cares. It will end up being the right choice later on."
 BOS_large_imf_loans: "Large IMF Loans"
 BOS_dayton_agreement: "Dayton Agreement Stipulations"
 BOS_dayton_agreement_desc: "The Dayton Agreement split our country into 2 entities and one special district, all based on ethnonationalist lines. This makes it hard to progress as a country and significantly reduces our stability. After all, the treaty wasnt even meant to last this long. It was supposed to be a temporary solution, but it is somehow becoming a permanent state of affairs."
 BOS_legacy_of_bosnian_war: "Legacy of the Bosnian War"
 BOS_legacy_of_bosnian_war_desc: "The Bosnian War was the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War 2. Many people have died in various genocides and this memory still remains in the heads of our people. It is a significant factor in our politics and there are many people who are bitter over the war's inconclusive results."
 BOS_one_country_three_peoples: "One Country, Three Peoples"
 BOS_one_country_three_peoples_desc: "Despite all the Ethnonationalist tensions our country faces, in the end all the peoples of the country are mostly equally represented and this allows a somewhat smooth momentum of stability but makes decision making way harder and way more complex. Many would say we are the most complex country in the world."
 BOS_keep_democratic_status_quo: "Keep the Democratic Status Quo"
 BOS_keep_democratic_status_quo_desc: "The truth is that the only way forward for Bosnia is not one of extremism or nationalism, but the one of democratic and euroatlantic integrations. We must become a part of western civilization or we won't even be a proper civilization in a few years. The choice is ours."
 BOS_three_member_presidency: "The 3-Member Presidency"
 BOS_three_member_presidency_desc: "Surprisingly, the Dayton Agreement established our nation as one which has 3 presidents from each of Bosnia's peoples. One is Croat, one is Serb and one is Bosniak. Each one serves a third of the 4 year term as the main president. (For the simplicity of the game, there will only be one president and no mechanic to switch every 1,5 years.)"
 BOS_sfor: "SFOR"
