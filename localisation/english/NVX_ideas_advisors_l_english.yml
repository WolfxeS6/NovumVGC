After leaving politics behind, he dedicated himself to being a criminal defense lawyer and has since then defended a long list of the most prominent and oft-abhorred criminals of contemporary Denmark - from child molesters to suspected terrorists to high-profile whistleblowers.

With one foot in the Danish industry and another in the middle of liberal politics, Arzrouni has been the personal advisor for a multitude of Danish ministers. Apart from this, he has been engaged in promoting liberalism in every way he could see fit - from being engaged in several liberal think tanks to writing sizable works on classical liberal thinkers to a short stint in the Council of Ethics. Regardless of political agreements and disagreements, there are few that doubt his ideological fervour."

 advisor_DEN_mads_holger:0 "Mads Holger"
 advisor_DEN_mads_holger_desc:0 "Mads Holger was, for most of his life, a writer and later radio host. Holger raised eyebrows with his scathing criticism of Danish liberalism. His criticism was not, as is often seen, coming from a leftist point of view, but rather from a conservative one, and the resulting national debate drove a wedge between part of the right wing of Danish politics. Later, Holger tried to run for political office as part of the Conservative Party, but was kicked out because of 'actions harmful to the party' - an accusation which Holger described as 'the actions of a dying patient who in his delirium lashes out at the doctor'."

His interviews, several of which went viral, were all done in the television news program 'Deadline', which quickly garnered a reputation as being one of the few places where even politicians could not get away with not answering the questions they were asked. After leaving Deadline, he continued to be active in the public discourse, later becoming the new Editor in Chief of the weekly newspaper Weekendavisen - the same newspaper which had granted him his first internship as a budding young journalist 23 years earlier."

 advisor_DEN_anders_samuelsen_desc:0 "Anders Samuelsen has been engaged in politics since the early 90's, but it was not until 2001 that he was elected as a full-time MP for the Danish Social Liberal Party. After becoming a MEP in 2004, in the summer of 2007 Samuelsen was one of three politicians - two social liberals and one former conservative - who co-founded the party New Alliance, later renamed Liberal Alliance. After internal fights in the party, he was eventually left as its sole head as it turned toward a more clearly defined economic liberalism, bordering on libertarianism."

 advisor_DEN_anders_fogh_rasmussen_desc:0 "The Danish prime minister throughout much of the 2000's, as well as later Secretary General of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen was a controversial figure during his domestic political career - and an even more controversial figure after it ended. Accused of dragging Danish troops into two unnecessary wars - the first offensive wars with Danish participation in centuries - his reputation as a warmonger culminated on March 18th 2003 when a left-wing activist forced himself past his bodyguards and covered him in red paint while shouting 'You have blood on your hands'."

She has also, at various points, served as the Danish ambassador to Israel and the Czech Republic, as fully-fledged UN ambassador representing Denmark in the UN Security Council, as head of the UN engagement in Liberia, and was in 2014 appointed by then-Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-Moon, as Special Representative and Head of the Mission in South Sudan. During the course of her long diplomatic career she has served as the highest-placed Dane in the UN system. In 2009 she became Commander 1st Class of the Order of Dannebrog, but also carries the Order of the Liberator General San Martín - the highest honor of Argentina."
 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen:0 "Daniel Carlsen"
 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen_desc:0 "The extreme right in Denmark has traditionally been small and scattered, with the Danish National Socialist Movement being treated more like a joke than a viable political movement. The situation became even stranger when a 17-year-old Daniel Carlsen joined the movement, according to himself because 'they were the only organisation who wanted to deport all immigrants, not talk about integration'. Despite his young age, Carlsen quickly made a name for himself appearing in a number of articles portraying him in mainstream media - and granting the Movement the kind of press attention that it hadn't seen for years. The success was short-lived however, as in 2011 he left the Movement and founded his own Party - the Party of the Danes - aiming for the political influence that he felt the Movement lacked. After attempting, and failing, at being elected to both local and national political office, Carlsen eventually left politics in 2017, causing his party to disband when nobody wished to succeed him as leader."

After the old Odense business E. Falck Schmidt went bankrupt in 2005 one would think that the business dynasty had ended. Not content to let that happen, Jan Falck-Schmidt spent the next two years single-handedly funding a new, revived business, the Falck Schmidt Defence Systems or FSDS, which would be wholly focused on producing military equipment for large-scale conflict. Since reviving the company in 2007, Falck-Schmidt and FSDS has experienced explosive growth in a very short amount of time, quelling any naysayers who would argue that there is no flourishing weapons industry in Denmark. As for the connection between his ancestor's rescue services and his own weapons manufacturing, Falck-Schmidt himself describes it as 'FSDS still save lives – now through our products and services, which aim to secure the lives and safe return of our soldiers.'"

Gauland became one of the three leading co-founders of the Election Alternative 2013, which ended up becoming the AfD. Whereas the other two, Konrad Adam and Bernd Lucke, were closer to the neo-liberal spectrum, Alexander Gauland was the leader of a national conservative school of thought within the AfD and would eventually find an ally in Frauke Petry. The two ended up eliminating Bernd Lucke in an internal power struggle, with Petry taking party leadership and Gauland becoming federal spokesman. Gauland's and Petry's faction ended up securing lots of popular support, with the AfD scoring as high as 24% of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt. In Gauland's home state Brandenburg, the result was still a considerable 12.2%. Gauland continues to guide AfD policy from behind the scenes, notably protecting controversial orator Björn Höcke from many inner-party consequences for Höcke's pro-nazi speeches."

Bush in the 2000 election - due to a margin of 527 votes in the state of Florida, which tipped the election to Bush. After his defeat, Gore left mainline politics and focussed on his environmentalist campaigns instead, with his frequent speeches, presentations and his 2006 documentary 'An Inconvenient Truth' warning of the possibly severe results of Global Warning - even though especially his documentary was accused of sensationalizing the topic, thus playing into the hands of sceptics. Gore had been talked about as a potential presidential candidate in both 2004 and 2008, but has instead chosen to largely stay away from elected office since his 2000 defeat against George W. Bush."

Bush's second term as president, becoming the highest-ranking Hispanic American in government up until that point in history. Gonzales was a key player in Bush's administration, supporting and enabling Donald Rumsfeld's defensive measurements against terrorism, which included 'enhanced interrogation techniques' and widespread surveillance of American citizens without either a warrant or a suspicion of guilt. After several controversial firings of government attorneys refusing persecution of political opponents, Gonzales was forced to resign as Attorney General on August 27th, 2007. After his political career, the former Air Force member resumed work as a private lawyer and as a recruiter and teacher at Texas Tech University."

While the Princeton graduate and former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and White House Chief of Staff is respected for many of his accomplishments, his part in the American response to the September 11 terrorist attacks makes his legacy a controversial one, with many people pointing to him as the mastermind behind wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq and as a pioneer of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' - or, as these methods might be more commonly known, state-authorized torture."

A long-time expert on foreign policy, he served as a long-time member and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. His votes in the senate on US foreign policy have been cause of debate, with Biden opposing the 1991 Gulf War, but voting in favor of the 1994/95 Bosnian Intervention and even the Iraq War in 2002, before turning around again and then opposing George W. Bush's 2007 plan to once again increase the number of American troops in the Middle East and in Iraq especially. After having sought the Democratic Nomination for President unsuccessfully in 1988 and in 2008, Biden became Barack Obama's running mate against the Republican McCain/Palin ticket, with the Democrats winning the election quite clearly. As Vice President, both his negotiation skill with House Republicans - finding compromises on the 2010 Job Creation Act and the 2011 Budget Control Act, among others - and his interest in veteran affairs were notable. Both the end of his long vice presidency and the death of his eldest son Joseph 'Beau' Robinette III made Biden take a break from politics, instead joining the University of Pennsylvania in a political and diplomatic institute."
