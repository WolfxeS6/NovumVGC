 #Army
 DEN_army:0 "Hæren"
 DEN_army_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Army is the land-based military of our country and a vital part of our military as a whole. We should look into ways of expanding its abilities."
 DEN_expand_barracks:0 "Expand the Barracks"
 DEN_expand_barracks_desc:0 "The capacity of our current barracks is woefully inadequate and must be expanded to accomodate our ever-expanding stream of brave recruits!"
 DEN_develop_artillery_models:0 "Develop Artillery Models"
 DEN_develop_artillery_models_desc:0 "Artillery has historically been an important part of the Danish army, and whether we expand into mechanizing our main forces or not, our artillery will always be there to lay down devastating covering fire. For this reason alone we should look into expanding and modernizing them."
 DEN_infantry_equipment_models_1:0 "New Infantry Equipment Models"
 DEN_infantry_equipment_models_1_desc:0 "Our army has been lacking funding for decades and large amounts of it is stuck with ancient equipment. We need to rectify this sad fact immediately!"
 DEN_land_doctrine_1:0 "Land Doctrine I"
 DEN_land_doctrine_1_desc:0 "As a small country, our tactics have always revolved around being smarter, if not outright stronger, than our opponents. Army doctrines are incredibly important for the overall effectiveness of our military encounters."
 DEN_land_doctrine_2:0 "Land Doctrine II"
 DEN_land_doctrine_2_desc:0 "The art of war is changing and we must change with it."
 DEN_close_Frederiksberg_Have:0 "Close Down Frederiksberg Garden"
 DEN_close_Frederiksberg_Have_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Military Academy is situated in Frederiksberg Castle next to the vast natural beauty of Frederiksberg Garden. If we close the Garden off from the public, the resulting expanded training areas vastly improve the effectiveness of the Academy. Of course, this will probably be protested by the public, but isn't the integrity of our nation's military more important than a few angry joggers?"
 DEN_joint_material_command:0 "Establish the Joint Material Command"
 DEN_joint_material_command_desc:0 "As part of our ongoing effort to modernize the army, several of our generals have recommended that we create a new entity to coordinate the purchase of new military equipment. This new Joint Material Command will ensure more effective military spending."
 DEN_hacker_recruitment_drive:0 "Hacker Recruitment Drive"
 DEN_hacker_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Cyberwarfare is the future and, sadly, our efforts in cyberspace could be better. To make matters worse, many qualified cybersecurity experts are joining anarchists and other subversive underground groups rather than our cybermilitary forces. If we're willing to overlook their checkered past, we may be able to recruit some of these hackers for our benefit."
 DEN_refurbish_FAK:0 "Refurbish FAK"
 DEN_refurbish_FAK_desc:0 "The Defence Academy, in Danish 'Forsvarsakademiet' or FAK is an independent entity in the military, which provides education, consultation and research for the benefit of our armed forced. Unfortunately, over time it has developed into a fragmented mess. Overhauling its structure and emphasizing its strategic importance could yield great benefit."
 DEN_streamline_infantry_production:0 "Streamline the Infantry Equipment Production"
 DEN_streamline_infantry_production_desc:0 "As a small country, we cannot depend on the vast industrial powers of some of our neighbours. However, if we streamline the production of our infantry equipment, we can ensure that when we produce something, we produce it cheaper and better than them."
 DEN_FAUK:0 "FAUK"
 DEN_FAUK_desc:0 "The Defence Judge Advocate Corps, in Danish 'Forsvarets Auditørkorps' or FAUK, is the legal branch of the Danish military, responsible for conducting any legal investigations involving the armed forces. If we expand their jurisdiction, we may be better equipped to ensure law and order anywhere our armed forces go."
 #Navy
 DEN_royal_navy:0 "Søværnet"
 DEN_royal_navy_desc:0 "We're situated strategically between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and the Royal Danish Navy has always been key to exercising our control in the area. It is by far the oldest branch of our military, harking all the way back to 1510, but still remains important to this day." 
 DEN_expand_Holmen:0 "Expand Holmen"
 DEN_expand_Holmen_desc:0 "Naval Base Copenhagen, more commonly known as Naval Base Holmen, is our first and largest naval base, dating from the 17th century. Even though it originally occupied the entirety of the water-bound neighbourhood Holmen in Copenhagen, it has since then been reduced to the island of Nyholm. We need to expand the naval base back to its original capacity, even if it will disappoint the many daily visitors."
 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy:0 "Refurbish the Royal Naval Academy"
 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy_desc:0 "At an age of more than 300 years, the Royal Danish Naval Academy has the honor of being the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world. Unfortunately, even for institutions, with age comes a sneaking decreptitude and the Naval Academy could really use some restructuring."
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR:0 "Establish OPLOG KOR"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_KOR_desc:0 "OPLOG KOR, short for Operative Logistical Support Korsør, is the local support infrastructure for our naval base in Korsør, FLS KOR. The naval base is home to a great part of our navy and as our navy expands more pressure will invariably be put on the support infrastructure. Thus, we should make expanding the OPLOGs a priority!"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_FRH:0 "Establish OPLOG FRH"
 DEN_establish_OPLOG_FRH_desc:0 "With OPLOG KOR already expanded, the time has come to expand the infrastructure of our other large naval base in Frederikshavn."
 DEN_streamline_naval_production:0 "Streamline the Naval Production"
 DEN_streamline_naval_production_desc:0 "We're an old seafaring nation and shipbuilding is interweaved into the very soul of our nation. Add to that our knack for figuring out how to improve and innovate and it's clear that we should be able to save on naval costs without having to cut corners on the quality of the equipment."
 DEN_ark_project:0 "The ARK Project"
 DEN_ark_project_desc:0 "The ARK Project is a Danish military project originally aimed at meeting the requirements for maritime transport capacity set by NATO to its members. Dedicating ourselves to the project will prioritize aquiring newer and better transport ships as well as give insight into convoy doctrines."
 DEN_new_ship_models:0 "New Ship Models"
 DEN_new_ship_models_desc:0 "We can't rely on foreign naval technologies forever. Maybe we should boost the budget of our own R&D departments and see if they can get a leg up on the competition."
 DEN_Lyngby_Radio:0 "Lyngby Radio"
 DEN_Lyngby_Radio_desc:0 "Lyngby Radio is a centrepoint of our naval communications. Though mainly used in cooperation with the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC), the radio operators working here have an expertise built up over many years, which would be invaluable in any future RADAR developments."
 DEN_naval_doctrine_1:0 "Naval Doctrine I"
 DEN_naval_doctrine_1_desc:0 "As our navy is our greatest military asset, so, too, must our greatest military theorists concentrate on improving and refining our naval doctrine."
 DEN_naval_doctrine_2:0 "Naval Doctrine II"
 DEN_naval_doctrine_2_desc:0 "We've already made headway into the art of war on the sea, but there's still room for improvements."
 DEN_establish_VFK:0 "Establish VFK"
 DEN_establish_VFK_desc:0 "Our Joint Services Defense Command, in Danish 'Værnsfælles Forsvarskommando' shortened VFK, will be the supreme authority of the Danish Defence, spanning all three main branches of the Danish armed forces. Situated directly underneath the Ministry of Defense, the establishment of this entity will undoutebly ensure a much greater degree of cooperation between the armed forces as well as a clearer chain of command."
 #Air Force
 DEN_air_force:0 "Flyvevåbnet"
 DEN_air_force_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Air Force is the youngest of our three professional military branches and was only established after the Second World War. Regardless, the aerial frontier is now more central to modern warfare than ever, and we must not lack behind in this area!"
 DEN_support_Terma:0 "Support Terma"
 DEN_support_Terma_desc:0 "Terma A/S is a Danish technology cooperation situated in Lysby in Jutland. Apart from manufacturing space and satellite technology, they specialize in RADAR equipment, fighter planes, helicopters and a host of other military electronics. Clearly we stand to benefit by supporting their work."
 DEN_Skrydstrup_air_base:0 "Expand Skrydstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skrydstrup_air_base_desc:0 "Ironically, the air base in Skrydstrup in Southern Jutland was founded by the Nazis during World War II as 'Fliegerhorst Hadersleben'. Today it serves as our Air Force's first line of defense if they should ever decide to visit us again. Just in case, let's expand it."
 DEN_early_fighter_models:0 "Early Fighter Models"
 DEN_early_fighter_models_desc:0 "We don't have a history of great aviation in Denmark and our R&D has been severely lacking on the subject. If we want to kickstart this industry, we need to start by researching some proper planes worth flying."
 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school:0 "Refurbish the Royal Air Force Officers School"
 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Air Force Officers School is the youngest of our great military academies, but is still lagging hopelessly behind other countries' air forces. Let's set aside the economy to bring the School back up to speed with the rest of the air forces in the world."
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base:0 "Expand Skalstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base_desc:0 "Our air base near Roskilde was previously armed with NIKE rockets and HAWK batteries that contributed massively to our anti-air capabilities on Zealand and whose prime directive was the protection of Copenhagen from air bombardments. These weapons have foolishly been shut down as part of a political austerity measure. That was a mistake - protecting our capital is of utmost importance!"
 DEN_advanced_bomber_models:0 "Advanced Bomber Models"
 DEN_advanced_bomber_models_desc:0 "Our earlier attempts at homegrown military airplane R&D was successful and several advisors are recommending that we expand the program to include bombers."
 DEN_air_doctrine_1:0 "Air Doctrine I"
 DEN_air_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Even the best planes in the world are useless if the pilot doesn't know what he's supposed to do. The strategies of our Air Force need to be written down into actual military doctrines to allow for better educating of the military personnel involved."
 DEN_air_doctrine_2:0 "Air Doctrine II"
 DEN_air_doctrine_2_desc:0 "Now that our air doctrine initiatives are well underway we can divert some of our greatest military minds to support the development of innovative new ways of ruling the skies."
 DEN_Karup_air_base:0 "Expand Karup Air Base"
 DEN_Karup_air_base_desc:0 "Karup in Jutland is home to our largest Air Base, not only the largest in Denmark but the largest in all of Northern Europe. As the pride and joy of our Air Force it reinforces the fact that even though we're a geographically small nation we're more than capable of punching above our weight class. Karup needs to be protected, to be respected - and perhaps even to be expanded."
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production:0 "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc:0 "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircrafts for the Air Force home. This would not only bring jobs, but, more importantly, allow us to cut out the middle men and streamline the infrastructure to ensure that we'll soon be able to cover the skies in red and white!"
 #Special Troops
 DEN_establish_SOKOM:0 "SOKOM"
 DEN_establish_SOKOM_desc:0 "The Special Operations Command, or SOKOM, is slated to be the High Command coordinating the deployment of any and all Danish special forces."
 DEN_mobilize_SSR:0 "Mobilize the SSR"
 DEN_mobilize_SSR_desc:0 "The Special Support and Reconnaissance Company, also known as Patrol Company Army Operational Command, is a unit specializing in reconnaissance both remotely and on the ground. Mobilizing them will grant a boost to reconnaissance missions."
 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps:0 "Mobilize the Hunter Corps"
 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps_desc:0 "The Hunter Corps, or 'Jægerkorpset' in Danish, is our main special operations force. Their motto, 'Plus esse, quam simultatur', 'More to be than to seem' refers to their understated, humble appearance. Almost nothing is known about the Hunter Corps, or its members, in the Danish public, which keeps the enemies of the country guessing about their true capabilities."
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen:0 "Mobilize the Frogmen"
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen_desc:0 "The Frogmen Corps, or in Danish 'Frømandskorpset' shortened FKP, is our maritime special operations force. The Frogmen Corps has an extremely exclusive selection training, as seen in the fact that since the Corps was founded in 1957 there has only been a little more than 300 Frogmen in total. As the elite forces of our strongest military branch, they are a must-have in any enemy encounter."
 DEN_sirius_patrol:0 "The Sirius Patrol"
 DEN_sirius_patrol_desc:0 "The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol is one of the most elite units in the Danish Naval Forces, tasked with long-distance reconnaissance and asserting Danish sovereignty in the most remote parts of the Arctic. Even though its main role is reconnaissance, all members of the Sirius Patrol receive elite combat training as they can at any given point be the first line of defense against attacks on Greenland."
 DEN_sirius_patrol_tt:0 "Gain an elite infantry division in Greenland.\n"

 #Status Quo
 DEN_welfare_state:0 "The Welfare State"
 DEN_welfare_state_desc:0 "The greatest challenge facing us today involves our unique Nordic welfare model. Whether for good or bad, we cannot deny the all-compassing influence of the welfare state, and any challenges to our way of life start there."
 DEN_expand_welfare_state:0 "Expand the Welfare State"
 DEN_expand_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state is a cornerstone of our society, and to touch it would be tantamount to sacrilege! In fact, we should not only protect the welfare state, but expand its reach beyond what it currently covers."
 DEN_balanced_approach:0 "Balanced Approach"

 DEN_shrink_welfare_state_desc:0 "The welfare state may have started out as a good idea, but have since then grown to become an all-consuming monster of a bureaucracy, which seizes both our freedoms and our money in the name of public welfare. It's time to put our foot down and shrink its reach."
 DEN_appease_unions:0 "Appease the Unions"
 DEN_appease_unions_desc:0 "Historically, the Social Democrat have always had very close ties with the unions, and with the political gains we have made recently, the unions are currently expecting that alliance to benefit them at the forthcoming tripartite negotiations."
 DEN_old_compromises:0 "Old Compromises"
 DEN_old_compromises_desc:0 "Political power in Denmark has historically been switching from the Social Democrats to the Liberals and Conservatives and back again. Only one party has managed to cross the divide and play both sides of the fence: The Social Liberal Party. By showing our willingness to compromise, we can gain more influence than we would in any opposition."
 DEN_new_ideas:0 "New Ideas"
 DEN_new_ideas_desc:0 "The politics of the 'big two' have been stale for some time now and it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell them apart by their politics.

 DEN_restrict_immigration:0 "Restrict Immigration"
 DEN_restrict_immigration_desc:0 "The first step towards preserving the Danish culture is restricting foreign influences, and the most effective way to do that is to restrict immigration. It may cause potential problems with our demographic distribution but surely it is worth it to protect the Denmark we know and love?"
 DEN_outlaw_hijab:0 "Outlaw the Hijab"
 DEN_outlaw_hijab_desc:0 "For some time now, patriots have voiced their concern that some women - mainly immigrants - are wearing what is widely considered a symbol of religious oppression so openly in our society. They claim that it is 'their own choice' but isn't that exactly what somebody who was forced to wear it would say? Regardless it certainly is very far from Danish culture. We should probably ban it before it spreads."
 DEN_antagonize_scandinavians:0 "Antagonize Scandinavia"

 DEN_fund_national_church:0 "Fund the National Church"
 DEN_fund_national_church_desc:0 "The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark is as Danish as anything, but it has experienced a sad decay in its number of members and every year we see fewer attendees at its sermons. We need to rectify this immediately - a well-structured campaign will get the flock back in the pen where it belongs!"
 DEN_revive_folk_high_school_movement:0 "Revive the Folk High Shool Movement"
 DEN_revive_folk_high_school_movement_desc:0 "The Folk School Movement started as an attempt to bring the values of Danish culture to every man and woman willing to attend - a truly noble goal, and one that should be not only preserved but expanded upon! An expanded system of folk high schools will make it possible to rally around the true Danish culture."
 DEN_venerate_country:0 "The Country"
 DEN_venerate_country_desc:0 "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the country. The last decades have brough waves of internationalists and globalists attacking the notion that a country is strongest on its own, but none of these new-fangled ideologies realize that the Danes and Denmark were doing just fine before they came along. Let us rally to Denmark, our fatherland!"
 DEN_venerate_values:0 "The Values"
 DEN_venerate_values_desc:0 "It's time to rally to the true foundation of our Danish culture - the values. A Dane is a Dane no matter where in the world he is.

 DEN_border_control_desc:0 "Our party member has for some time now demanded that the government view illegal immigration as the prime evil threatening our society today.

However, that would require changing large parts of the Constitution - perhaps it would be easier to draft a new one altogether."

 DEN_arabian_allies_desc:0 "Historically, there's not really a lot of Islamic history in Scandinavia and our newly founded emirate is diplomatically very isolated. Let's reach out to our fellow muslim countries in the Arab League and forge new political bonds."
 DEN_abolish_monarchy:0 "Abolish the Monarchy"
 DEN_abolish_monarchy_desc:0 "The Queen and the institution she represents are both relics from a bygone era. We are united in carving out a future without kings and queens, where all are born equal. The Queen must abdicate and be exiled, no matter the cost!"
 DEN_nazification:0 "Nazification"
 DEN_nazification_desc:0 "Now that our Movement is in control of the state, it's time to set our Great Plan in motion. First, we must take steps towards making the people realize the true potential of their noble heritage."
 DEN_purge_the_dissidents:0 "Purge the Dissidents"
 DEN_purge_the_dissidents_desc:0 "Our people cannot achieve greatness if it is riddled with dissenters spreading chaos and lies. If we must rid ourselves of these blights on our great nation to achieve purity and power then so be it!"
 DEN_world_caliphate:0 "World Caliphate"
 DEN_world_caliphate_desc:0 "The time to bring about the promised change is now! Let us all recite the Shahada: lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh muḥammadun rasūlu llāh - 'There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God.' We will spread this one true message to all the people in the world - all will be made to see the Word of Allah or perish in their self-inflicted blindness!"
 DEN_peaceful_revolution:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
 DEN_peaceful_revolution_desc:0 "Our revolution needs not be a bloody one - by emphasizing the democratic aspects of socialism we may encourage our supporters to encourage voting rather than shooting their way to the revolution. Let us make our revolution a peaceful one."
 DEN_raise_unemployment_benefits:0 "Raise Unemployment Benefits"
 DEN_raise_unemployment_benefits_desc:0 "The downtrotten and unemployed are usually a target whenever somebody needs to be blamed for a downturn in the economy. We, however, recognize that being unemployed does not make you less of a citizen than your neighbour."
 DEN_improve_public_sector:0 "Improve Public Sector"
 DEN_improve_public_sector_desc:0 "We are in control of one of the most well-known welfare systems on the planet, yet many years of austerity measures have made it hollow and weak. We need to change that."
 DEN_dismantle_danish_realm:0 "Dismantle the Danish Realm"
 DEN_dismantle_danish_realm_desc:0 "Our overseas possessions are the last remnants of an ugly colonial history from a time when racist nationalism and expansionism permeated our culture. We are past that part of our history, so let us grant these relics the independence that they so wish for and rightfully deserve."
 DEN_seize_state_power:0 "Seize the State!"
 DEN_seize_state_power_desc:0 "The time is right! Send out the message that all in support of a worker's paradise arm themselves! We march upon the centres of power and we will accept nothing less than the total capitulation of the government!"
 DEN_suspend_civil_liberties:0 "Suspend Civil Liberties"
 DEN_suspend_civil_liberties_desc:0 "After repeated purges, our population is now truly purified. However, many still seem reluctant to die for our cause, and some if these archaic notions of 'individual rights' and 'freedom' are hampering our grand plans of conquest. Let's rid ourselves of these ridiculous notions once and for all - our people will see greatness, even if we have to force them!"
 DEN_expropriate_industry:0 "Expropriate the Industry"
 DEN_expropriate_industry_desc:0 "Privatization has done nothing but ensure skyrocketing prices and plummeting wages. In order to properly govern this country, we need to govern the industry as well. As we control the army and police, expropriation really shouldn't be much of a problem. Afterwards, we can benefit from an increased efficiancy free from the shackles of foreign investors and heartless profiteers."
 DEN_new_foreign_policy:0 "New Foreign Policy"
 DEN_new_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Denmark is often treated as a junior member of the international society, punching above our weight. Things haven't always been that way, though. 'Denmark' used to be a name which was uttered with respect and Danes used to be a proud people, unafraid to explore new frontiers and expand the reach of the Danish Realm. We can be that way again, we WILL be that way again!"
 DEN_world_revolution:0 "World Revolution"
 DEN_world_revolution_desc:0 "Workers of the world, unite! Marx and Engels made it abundantly clear in their Communist Manifesto that the revolution could only succeed if it was worldwide. We will free the workers of the world from their nationalist shackles, even if it may take a little... persuasion."
 DEN_crackdown_on_opposition:0 "Crackdown on Opposition"
 DEN_crackdown_on_opposition_desc:0 "Our stated goal has always been to free the people from their oppression, yet a large minority still remain defiant against the people's will. We cannot allow our progress to become undone by stubborn reactionaries and so, for the good of the many, we may need to silence the few."
 DEN_demand_the_duchies:0 "Demand the Duchies"
 DEN_demand_the_duchies_desc:0 "Schleswig and Holstein was always Danish possessions, and they have remained so in spirit, even after they were so tragically lost in 1864. Our new, greater Denmark is more capable than ever and the population is longing to be reunited with their long-lost brothers and sisters. We may even take Saxe-Lauenburg as well for good measure."
 DEN_revive_colonialism:0 "Revive Colonialism"
 DEN_revive_colonialism_desc:0 "These days colonialism is treated as a black chapter of most national histories, associated with racism and oppession as if that's a bad thing! Clearly the common sense is wrong on this one - as we look around us in the world today we see it in dire need of a guiding hand. We will make sure that hand is Danish."
 DEN_colonize_Ghana:0 "Colonize Ghana"

 DEN_retake_Indian_colonies_desc:0 "Denmark once had several colonies on the Indian subcontinent. Today, India is on the road to becoming a true superpower, so if we ever want to regain our lost possessions it's now or never."
 DEN_demand_Virgin_Islands:0 "Demand the Virgin Islands"
 DEN_demand_Virgin_Islands_desc:0 "The islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John and Saint Croix were previously known as the 'Danish West Indies'. Today they are known as a black stain on our national history with the ghost of slavery looming over every conversation. However, all this self-hatred is not useful for our expansionist agenda. Instead of apologizing, maybe we should just retake them from the United States."
 DEN_unify_scandinavia:0 "Unify Scandinavia"
 DEN_unify_scandinavia_desc:0 "We've always had a rocky relationship with our northern neighbours, but perhaps it's time to reclaim our old territorial possessions - Norway was lost in 1814, Iceland as recently as 1944 and we all know how Danes feel about Sweden..."
 DEN_invade_iceland:0 "Invade Iceland"
 DEN_invade_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland was the last part of our realm to break away, cowardly doing so during the German Occupation of Denmark in 1944. The Denmark of today, however, is stronger and we will not allow this insult to stand!"
 DEN_reestablish_denmark_norway:0 "Re-Establish Denmark-Norway"
 DEN_reestablish_denmark_norway_desc:0 "We've stated our intent to unify Scandinavia, yet the Norwegians stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their place in the historical Kingdom of Denmark-Norway!

 DEN_Danelaw:0 "Danelaw"
 DEN_Danelaw_desc:0 "Danelaw was historically the part of England where the laws of the Danes trumped those of the Anglo-Saxons. As our laws are, by their very nature, above those of the British imbeciles, perhaps we should do their legal systems a favor and re-establish the Danelaw?"
 DEN_reclaim_Normandy:0 "Reclaim Normandy"
 DEN_reclaim_Normandy_desc:0 "Back in the viking glory days, Rollo, or Rolf, was crowned the first ruler of Normandy. Medieval sources differ on whether his family was from Denmark or Norway, but Norway is basically Danish anyway so regardless, we can spin this into a reason to reclaim one of our historical possessions! Let history recall the dragons' flight across the waves!"
 DEN_proclaim_north_sea_empire:0 "Proclaim the North-Sea Empire"
 DEN_proclaim_north_sea_empire_desc:0 "We've united the ancient holdings of Cnut the Great, and even added a bit to the legacy. We can now truly call ourselves an Empire of the North Sea!"

 DEN_free_finland:0 "Free Finland"
 DEN_free_finland_desc:0 "We've not really sure what to do about Finland. Judging by their national history, they will fight annexation to their deaths, but perhaps we can control them more subtly - after all, "Finlandization" is an actual term describing just that."
 DEN_free_iceland:0 "Free Iceland"
 DEN_free_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland earned their territorial freedom in 1944, but their political freedom will have to be curtailed before they hurt themselves or others."
