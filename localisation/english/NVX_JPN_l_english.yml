But in Japan, Girl Power is widely used as an anti-feminist word. Girl Power(Joshiryoku) is a 'Power' that shows how conservative and obedient values a Japanese woman can be loved by men. If she is good at makeup or cooking and has the ability to like men, she is rated as having a high 'Girl Power'.\nGirl Power is once again attracting attention as Japan's patriarchal military dictatorship enters. Experts say that Girl Power has become popular with women as Japanese women are removed from work. Japanese feminists have struggled to drive out Girl Power, but they are unlikely to succeed because of military interference."
