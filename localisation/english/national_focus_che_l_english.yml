 CHE_rise_of_kadyrov_desc:0 "We should distance ourselves from Maskhadov’s failed approach to the conflict and support Akhmad Kadyrov’s bid for leadership. By contacting Moscow, we can offer cooperation in exchange for support in restoring order."
 CHE_kadyrov_tt:0 "We will contact §Y[SOV.GetLeader]§! and offer him our support in the §Y2nd Chechen War§!. If he accepts, §Y[SOV.GetNameDef]§! will release Chechnya as a puppet and §YAkhmad Kadyrov§! will be it's new leader after the war ends."
 CHE_fortify_countryside:0 "Fortify Our Countryside"
 CHE_fortify_countryside_desc:0 "The cities may fall, but the countryside will not yield so easily.

 CHE_fortify_grozny:0 "Fortify Grozny"
 CHE_fortify_grozny_desc:0 "Grozny is the heart of our nation — and it must not fall easily. We will strengthen its defenses, prepare urban strongpoints, and turn the city into a fortress. If the enemy wants our capital, they will have to pay dearly for every street and building."
 CHE_retreat_mountains:0 "Retreat to the Mountains"
 CHE_retreat_mountains_desc:0 "We can no longer hold our ground in the lowlands. To preserve our leadership and continue the struggle, we will withdraw into the Caucasus Mountains.

 CHE_national_elections:0 "Hold National Elections"
 CHE_national_elections_desc:0 "Though Chechens have voted before, this is the first time as citizens of a fully sovereign state.

 CHE_green_city_desc:0 "To improve urban life and move beyond the ruins of war, Grozny’s destroyed industrial areas and ruined multistory buildings will be cleared and converted into parks.

 CHE_invite_rosneft:0 "Invite Rosneft"
 CHE_invite_rosneft_desc:0 "Our oil infrastructure lies in ruins, and rebuilding it alone is beyond our current means. By inviting Rosneft to develop the sector, we can restore production and attract vital investment - though it comes at the cost of outside control over our resources."
