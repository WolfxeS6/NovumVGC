In a rare turn of events the Koch coalition has petitioned the judge of the case to allow Babayan house arrest during the proceedings to calm protestors."
 ARM.2.o1:0 "Interesting"
 ARM.3.t:0 "Military Coup"

After the shooting Aram Sargsyan was appointed after the death of his older brother, as part of the recovery process Kocharyan has now replaced him with loyalist Andranik Margaryan."

 ARM.5.t:0 "A Velvet Revolution"
 ARM.5.d:0 "Pashinyan and his followers have marched from Gyumri to the capital Verevan after 2 weeks and 200 km of walking. Leading his supporters he attempted to force the government to capitulate.

 ARM.8.o1:0 "Our nerves are not fully calmed"
 ARM.9.t:0 "A Violet Revolution"
 ARM.9.d:0 "Through the joint effort of all opposition parties and the people, we have taken down the corrupt government.

Although our nation is more fractured than ever, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow."
 ARM.9.o1:0 "Together, United."
 ARM.10.t:0 "Stabalising the Nation"
 ARM.10.d:0 "It is without any question that the nation is fractured beyond belief, the people need to rally behind one group rather than the current dysfunctional coalition."

 ARM.10.o2:0 "A joint effort is the only way"
 ARM.10.o2:0 "Is this really the right path?"
 ARM.11.t:0 "Counter Revolution!"
