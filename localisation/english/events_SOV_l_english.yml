Especially through his resolute policy regarding Chechnya, the previously unknown Putin generally earned the approval of the Russian public. Now, elections for the office of President are being held, and Putin is looking to have his government confirmed.\n\nThe other candidates include the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky, the neo-Soviet communist Zyuganov and the democratic liberal Yavlinsky."

 russia.1.t:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometres north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his sceptics may expect."
 russia_news.1.o1:0 "Let's see how he does."

 russia_news.3.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has seen its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, elected to the presidency. This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1:0 "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t:0 "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d:0 "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described as a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favoured among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."

It contains focus tree, which you can see right now. Russia has a lot of problems with its military and industry. After dealing with debuffs, you can build military with, perhaps, biggest artillery buffs in the game; special forces are also massively favoured; other military buffs are comparable with what other countries have. Foreign policy branch is centered around unification of post-soviet countries more or less peacefully.\n\n2. §OYavlinsky path.§! It is less interesting and contains an opportunity to join NATO and EU. To open this path, you should choose Yavlinsky as president elections winner.\n\n3. §RSoviet path§! offers you massive industry buffs. Note, that it is more of a late-game build, as you will likely suffer in the beginning. Soviet army offers great complience/dealing with resistance opportunities, as well as armor and some other minor buffs. Soviet foreign diplomacy allows you to ignite civil war in post-soviet space and quickly capture Ukraine, Belarus and Kazahstan.

Before the passage of Soviet troops on the streets of the city, anti-communist terror reigned. The troops intended to hold the city for a long time, so they prudently cleared the city of possible Soviet associates. Someone was seized and taken away from the city, and some were shot on the streets according to the laws of wartime."
