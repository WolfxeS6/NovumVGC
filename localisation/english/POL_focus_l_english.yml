 Poland_Events_News.169.t:0 "The Return of the Milk Bars"
 Poland_Events_News.169.d:0 "Milk Bars, also known as Bar Mleczny, have been a staple in polish gastronomy for centuries, with the first milk bar, "Mleczarnia Nadświdrzańska" dating back to 1896 when it served a wide array of dairy items, as well as other traditional polish indulgences. As time went on, these milk bars grew in popularity, and were eventually nationalised by the post-war communist regime as a means of providing low-cost meals to the poor working class with no access to a canteen at their workplace. The culinary aspect aside, milk bars were popular social gathering spots for a wide range of people, including workers, officials, university professors, students, and pensioners. Many of these bars are still open today and remain a popular destination for Poles of all ages, and especially old folk, to enjoy traditional egg cutlets, pancakes, dumplings, soups and fresh dairy products. The recent rise to power of the new socialist regime has only increased the popularity of these important culinary destinations, and the number of subsidised bars is growing by the day."
