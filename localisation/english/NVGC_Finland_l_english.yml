FIN_islamist_party_long:0 "Suomen Islamilainen Puolue\n§LIslamic Party of Finland§!"
FIN_party_nrm:0 "SVL"
FIN_party_nrm_long:0 "Suomen vastarintaliike\n§LFinnish Resistance Movement§!\n§gThe Finnish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement is an openly neo-Nazi organization seeking the creation of an ethnically homogeneous, authoritarian Finnish state. Rejecting democracy, globalization, and liberal values, the movement embraces revolutionary violence and racial ideology. Though small in number, its disciplined structure and willingness to exploit instability make it a serious threat during periods of national crisis — one that challenges the very foundations of the Finnish republic.§!"
FIN_party_fdf:0 "Puolustusvoimat"
FIN_party_fdf_long:0 "Puolustusvoimat\n§LFinnish Defence Forces§!\n§gOfficially non-partisan, the Finnish Defence Forces exist to safeguard Finland’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Highly professional and deeply shaped by Finland’s history of existential threats, the FDF commands significant public trust. In times of political collapse, however, its role becomes ambiguous — protector of democracy, guarantor of order, or, in extreme circumstances, ruler of last resort.§!"
FIN_party_ps:0 "PS"
FIN_party_ps_long:0 "Perussuomalaiset\n§LFinns Party§!\n§gA populist and nationalist force, the Finns Party draws support from voters disillusioned with globalization, immigration, and political elites. Blending social conservatism with welfare chauvinism, the party presents itself as the defender of “ordinary Finns” against foreign influence and domestic elites. While officially rejecting extremism, its rhetoric and voter base often overlap with more radical nationalist movements, placing it at the center of Finland’s political polarization.§!"
FIN_party_kd:0 "KD"
FIN_party_kd_long:0 "Kristillisdemokraatit\n§LChristian Democrats§!\n§gThe Christian Democrats emphasize social conservatism, Christian ethics, and family-centered policies, while supporting democracy and social responsibility. Though small in size, the party often punches above its weight by acting as a kingmaker in conservative coalitions. In times of instability, KD positions itself as a moral anchor, advocating order and tradition while rejecting both socialist radicalism and overt extremism.§!"
FIN_party_kok:0 "KOK"
FIN_party_kok_long:0 "Kansallinen Kokoomus\n§LNational Coalition Party§!\n§gThe National Coalition Party stands for economic liberalism, Western alignment, and conservative values tempered by pragmatism. Historically divided between moderate liberal conservatives and harder nationalist elements, Kokoomus has often positioned itself as the party of stability, business interests, and strong governance. In times of national crisis, its emphasis on order and institutional strength makes it a natural contender for leadership — though critics accuse it of enabling authoritarian tendencies when stability is threatened.§!"
FIN_party_kesk:0 "KESK"
FIN_party_kesk_long:0 "Suomen Keskusta\n§LCentre Party§!\n§gThe Centre Party traces its roots to Finland’s agrarian movements and continues to champion rural communities, decentralization, and regional autonomy. Positioned between left and right, KESK has long acted as a political balancer, prioritizing national unity and pragmatic governance over ideology. Yet as urban-rural divides deepen and populist movements challenge its traditional base, the Centre Party finds itself fighting to remain the voice of Finland’s countryside.§!"
FIN_social_democrat_party:0 "SDP"
FIN_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue\n§LSocial Democratic Party of Finland§!\n§gTraditionally the dominant force of Finnish politics, the Social Democratic Party represents the interests of workers, trade unions, and the welfare state. Rooted in parliamentary democracy and reformism, the SDP seeks social justice through gradual change rather than revolution. However, years of crisis, internal divisions, and pressure from both radical leftists and resurgent right-wing movements have left the party increasingly strained, forced to defend democratic norms in an increasingly polarized Finland.§!"
FIN_party_vihr:0 "VIHR"
FIN_party_vihr_long:0 "Vihreä liitto\n§LGreen League§!\n§gEmerging from environmental and social movements, the Green League advocates for ecological sustainability, civil liberties, and progressive social reform. Strongly pro-democracy and critical of authoritarianism, the Greens are vocal opponents of both far-right nationalism and heavy-handed state repression. Their influence has grown alongside environmental concerns, but their ideals often clash with the demands of security and order during periods of unrest.§!"
FIN_party_vas:0 "vas."
FIN_party_vas_long:0 "Vasemmistoliitto\n§LLeft Alliance§!\n§gThe Left Alliance is a broad coalition of socialists, democratic leftists, and former communists advocating economic equality, workers’ rights, and expanded public services. Though committed to parliamentary democracy, its more radical factions have increasingly embraced anti-capitalist and anti-globalist rhetoric, especially during periods of unrest. To its critics, the party represents a destabilizing force; to its supporters, it is the last bulwark against authoritarianism and unchecked capitalism.§!"
FIN_party_skp:0 "SKP"
FIN_party_skp_long:0 "Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue\n§LCommunist Party of Finland§!\n§gThe Communist Party of Finland represents the revolutionary socialist tradition, advocating the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of a socialist state. Marginal in electoral politics but influential within activist circles and labor movements, the SKP has gained renewed attention amid economic hardship and political unrest. To the establishment, it is a dangerous relic of the past; to its supporters, it is a necessary alternative to a system they believe has failed the working class.§!"

FIN_suppress_reactionary_remnants_desc: "Every vestige of the old reactionary order—nationalists, clergy, capitalists, and their collaborators—must be crushed before they can regroup and threaten the revolution. We must deploy security forces, informants, and emergency decrees to root out counter-revolutionaries. Stability demands force; the proletariat will not yield."

FIN_seize_bourgeoisie_assets_desc: "The Socialist Republic faces an urgent funding crisis, but Finland is rich with bloated banks, mansions, and factories of the bourgeoisie and wealthy elites.

FIN_kinship_question: "The Kinship Question"
FIN_kinship_question_desc: "The question of Finland’s kin beyond its borders has never truly been resolved. While the era of open warfare has passed, the legacy of the Kinship Wars endures as a political and cultural concept — one that emphasizes solidarity, protection, and self-determination for Finnic peoples.

FIN_managing_russian_question_desc: "Finland’s relationship with Russia remains the single most consequential factor in our national security.

Rather than risking escalation, we must pursue a pragmatic approach — one that safeguards Finnish sovereignty while reducing the likelihood of open conflict along our eastern border."
FIN_confront_eastern_threat: "Confront the Eastern Threat"
FIN_confront_eastern_threat_desc: "Russia’s continued dominance over historically Finnic and Finno-Ugric lands represents an unresolved injustice of the post–Cold War settlement.

FinlandRainbow.1.t: "Sending the Invitations to the Conference"
FinlandRainbow.1.d: "As preparations for the coalition conference near completion, we must invite representatives from the Left Alliance, Green League, and National Coalition to join us. Let us ensure a smooth start to this critical summit."
FinlandRainbow.1.a: "Send the invitations!"

FinlandRainbow.2.t: "The Left Alliance and Green League Arrive"
FinlandRainbow.2.d: "The Left Alliance and Green League delegations have arrived without incident, but tensions are already rising as they debate the details of their reform proposals. We must keep the peace to ensure productive talks."
FinlandRainbow.2.a: "Let’s Hope Everything Remains Peaceful."

FinlandRainbow.3.t: "The National Coalition Arrives"
FinlandRainbow.3.d: "The National Coalition delegation has arrived, maintaining distance from the Left Alliance to avoid clashes. Their commitment to compromise is clear, provided it aligns with their free-market principles."
FinlandRainbow.3.a: "Well, at least they're prepared."

FinlandRainbow.4.t: "The Conference is Prepared"
FinlandRainbow.4.d: "With all parties seated, the coalition conference is ready to begin. Let us set aside differences and work for the Republic’s greater good!"
FinlandRainbow.4.a: "Let's begin!"

FinlandRainbow.5.t: "The Future Powers of the President"
FinlandRainbow.5.d: "The National Coalition argues that President Tarja Halonen’s ceremonial role limits her ability to guide Finland effectively. They propose increasing her powers, including stronger veto authority over legislation, to bolster national unity. However, this risks undermining the Eduskunta and angers the Left Alliance and Greens, who see it as a conservative power grab sowing dissent."
FinlandRainbow.5.a: "Accept the KOK's proposal."
FinlandRainbow.5.b: "The President is a Unifying Figurehead First, This is Madness!"

NVGCfinland.1.t: "The Republic of Finland"
NVGCfinland.1.d: "The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 shattered the foundation of Finland's post-war geopolitical strategy. Long walking a delicate line of neutrality and quiet diplomacy, the Finnish government suddenly found itself navigating a new Europe—one no longer divided by iron curtains but still weighed down by ideological shadows.\n\nThe 1990s were a decade of uncertainty. A severe economic depression early in the decade undermined public confidence in state institutions, while traditional industries crumbled under the weight of global competition and rapid modernization. Yet amidst this turmoil, a new political era emerged.\n\nIn 1995, the formation of Lipponen's Rainbow Government—a broad coalition of Social Democrats, the National Coalition Party, the Left Alliance, Greens, and the Swedish People's Party—symbolized both opportunity and fragility. For the first time, parties from across the ideological spectrum were brought together in a delicate act of political balancing. Finland's accession to the European Union that same year was heralded as a new beginning, but it came with strings attached: integration, regulation, and the slow erosion of self-determined policy in favor of continental consensus.\n\nBy 1999, the coalition was re-elected, but not without strain. The cracks in unity had grown more visible. Compromise was no longer a choice—it was a necessity. Ideological differences, once subdued by the urgency of economic recovery, now simmered under the surface. The promise of a bold future had given way to a more cautious reality: survival through consensus, progression through negotiation.\n\nAs the new millennium begins, Finland stands at a crossroads. The coalition holds—for now—but its stability is fragile. Competing visions for Finland's future, from integrationist liberalism to resurgent nationalism and lingering leftist ideals, tug at the seams of the government. In this uncertain climate, every decision risks igniting old divisions or creating new ones.\n\nThe dream of a confident, independent Finland remains alive—but it must be tempered by patience, vigilance, and compromise. This is not yet an era of triumph. It is a time of recovery, where every step forward must be carefully measured against the risk of falling back into chaos."
NVGCfinland.1.a: "Jatka varovasti."

NVGCfinland.2.t: "The Rainbow Collapses!"
NVGCfinland.2.d: "The Rainbow Government, the fragile coalition of Social Democrats, National Coalition, Greens, Left Alliance, and Swedish People’s Party since 1995, has collapsed under ideological strife and public distrust. Gridlock, clashing agendas on EU integration, decentralization, and welfare, and ministerial breakdowns have shattered the coalition. Protests rock Helsinki, Turku, and Oulu, while radical movements exploit the chaos, signaling a constitutional crisis. Finland’s future hangs in the balance."
NVGCfinland.2.a: "Voi helvetti..."

NVGCfinland.4.t: "Decisive Victory Against the NRM"
NVGCfinland.4.d: "Prime Minister [FIN.GetLeader], supported by the Eduskunta and General Kim Jäämeri, orders a swift military crackdown on the Nordic Resistance Movement. The Finnish Army, under Chief of Defence Juhani Kaskeala, efficiently neutralizes the rebels across urban centers with minimal collateral damage. Despite minor NRM sympathies in lower ranks, Esa Henrik Holappa and key leaders are arrested, and stringent measures prevent the group’s resurgence. The SDP emerges as a staunch defender of democracy, bolstering public confidence in the government and military."
NVGCfinland.4.a: "Finland stands united!"

NVGCfinland.5.t: "Betrayal and Collapse"
NVGCfinland.5.d: "Prime Minister [FIN.GetLeader] and Chief of Defence Juhani Kaskeala deploy forces to crush the Nordic Resistance Movement, but General Pasi Välimäki’s troops face mass dissent, with some units joining the NRM. The rebellion surges, seizing key sites and launching a March on Helsinki. Conservative politicians flee, destabilizing the government. As defenses collapse, Haatainen and Kaskeala are captured, and President Tarja Halonen flees. NRM leader Esa Henrik Holappa declares a provisional government, placing Finland under far-right control."
NVGCfinland.5.a: "Finland faces a new reality."

NVGCfinland.6.t: "Emergency Stabilization"
NVGCfinland.6.d: "The Nordic Resistance Movement’s rebellion escalates, threatening civilian life and infrastructure. General Ahti Kurvinen initially stays neutral, hoping to avoid conflict. As disorder spreads, Kurvinen convenes a command council and launches a targeted military operation to arrest NRM leaders, including Esa Henrik Holappa, and secure key institutions. Avoiding civilian clashes, the Army restores stability, temporarily suspending the government with the aim of reinstating civilian rule once order is secured. Kurvinen’s decisive action prevents full-scale civil war."
NVGCfinland.6.a: "Will the Kenraali save us?"

NVGCfinland.12.t: "The Revolution Secures Itself"
NVGCfinland.12.d: "Following the Nordic Resistance Movement’s “Patriotic Revolution,” Helsinki’s streets shift from chaos to military patrols and victory parades. Supported by defected Finnish Defence Forces, the NRM regime swiftly targets remaining opposition—social democrats, unionists, and socialists. A decree brands the previous government illegitimate, accusing it of “globalist decay and Marxist rot.” Finland faces a radical new era under NRM control."
NVGCfinland.12.a: "The traitors will be dealt with..."

NVGCfinland.19.t: "Fighting unemployment"
NVGCfinland.19.d: "With unemployment still hovering near 10%, Finland finds itself in a precarious recovery—too distant from the crisis to act with panic, yet too vulnerable to grow complacent. In parliament, proposals diverge: the Social Democrats call for expansive public works to create immediate jobs and strengthen the welfare state; the National Coalition and Christian Democrats press for investment in agriculture, seeking revival through rural stability and traditional industry; the Centre Party, ever the mediators, urge a path of compromise, blending welfare with rural investment to bridge Finland’s urban-rural divide. Now, with the future of Finland’s economic direction in delicate balance, all eyes turn to Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader]. The decision must be swift—but above all, it must be wise."
NVGCfinland.19.a: "We need jobs quickly. Expand public works."
NVGCfinland.19.b: "The rural people need the most help."
NVGCfinland.19.c: "We have money to spare. Do both."

NVGCfinland.21.t: "The [GetYear] Parliamentary Elections"
NVGCfinland.21.d: "As Finland grapples with recent political upheavals, the [GetYear] Parliamentary Elections mark a pivotal moment. Voters choose among major contenders: the Social Democratic Party, championing workers’ rights and welfare; the Centre Party, advocating rural interests and decentralization; and the National Coalition Party, pushing economic liberalism and stability. Talks of a Social Democrat-Centre coalition aim to preserve democracy, but tensions persist. On the right, the Christian Democrats and Finns Party unite as the Syvän Sininen Liitto ('Deep Blue Coalition'), blending conservatism, nationalism, and populism, gaining traction amid the dissatisfied."
NVGCfinland.21.a: "The Social Democratic Party is victorious!"
NVGCfinland.21.b: "The Social Democrats and Centre form a coalition!"
NVGCfinland.21.c: "The Centre Party is victorious!"
NVGCfinland.21.e: "The National Coalition is victorious!"
NVGCfinland.21.f: "The KD-PS alliance secures a surprising victory!"
NVGCfinland.21.g: "The SKS take over in a sudden victory!"

NVGCfinland.22.t: "The Red Soil Government"
NVGCfinland.22.d: "Reviving a historic alliance from 1937, the Red Soil government merges the Social Democratic Party’s progressive vision with the Centre Party’s agrarian roots. The “red” of social democracy and the “soil” of rural centrism symbolize a united [Root.GetName], though skeptics doubt the coalition’s longevity amid modern challenges."
NVGCfinland.22.a: "It's a New Era of Cooperation."

NVGCfinland.23.t: "Success Against Radicalism"
NVGCfinland.23.d: "The Red Soil government’s moderate policies, blending SDP’s social welfare with KESK’s rural focus, have successfully curbed radical tendencies. Collaborative initiatives, including dialogue with opposition parties, have eased public tensions and strengthened national cohesion."
NVGCfinland.23.a: "A Step Towards Unity."

NVGCfinland.24.t: "Fostering [Root.GetAdjective] Patriotism"
NVGCfinland.24.d: "The Red Soil coalition unveils a campaign to ignite national pride, emphasizing Finland’s independence in the face of Russian pressures. Through public initiatives and cultural programs, we rally the people to defend our sovereignty, ensuring the Republic stands firm against any threat from the Kremlin."
NVGCfinland.24.a: "United we Stand!"

NVGCfinland.25.t: "Mending Societal Divisions"
NVGCfinland.25.d: "The Red Soil government, haunted by the Rainbow Government’s struggles, seeks to heal Finland’s societal rifts. Prominent SDP and Centre Party leaders have met with moderates from both left and right, launching initiatives to unite the Finnish people as one nation. Only time will reveal the success of this endeavor."
NVGCfinland.25.a: "We must foster unity."

NVGCfinland.26.t: "Dissolution of Red Soil Government"
NVGCfinland.26.d.socdem: "The Social Democrats have chosen to prioritize workers, sidelining the Centre Party’s agrarian agenda. Outraged, Centre Party representatives have withdrawn from the Red Soil government, ending the coalition. While the SDP can now focus on its constituents, this fracture risks polarizing Finland’s politics."
NVGCfinland.26.d.soclib: "The Centre Party’s focus on farmers has sidelined the Social Democrats’ worker agenda, prompting SDP representatives to withdraw from the Red Soil government. This collapse strengthens KESK’s base but risks deepening Finland’s political divides."
NVGCfinland.26.a: "We need a clear focus."

NVGCfinland.27.t: "Red Soil Unity Prevails"
NVGCfinland.27.d: "Defying expectations of collapse, the Social Democrats and Centre Party have united to support both workers and farmers. This commitment to cooperation strengthens the Red Soil government, signaling a new era of political harmony in Finland."
NVGCfinland.27.a: "Long live the Red Soil government."

NVGCfinland.28.t: "Support for Our Voters"
NVGCfinland.28.d.socdem: "The Social Democrats have prioritized workers through subsidies and improved factory conditions. While this boosts SDP support, the Centre Party and National Coalition decry the neglect of their constituents, accusing the SDP of selfish governance."
NVGCfinland.28.d.soclib: "The Centre Party has prioritized farmers with subsidies and improved crop access. While boosting KESK support, the SDP and National Coalition criticize this as neglecting broader economic needs, accusing KESK of favoritism."
NVGCfinland.28.a: "We need a clear focus."

NVGCfinland.29.t: "SDP’s Strategic Crossroads"
NVGCfinland.29.d: "Under Paavo Lipponen’s leadership, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has shifted toward a centrist, patriotic stance while maintaining its commitment to workers’ rights, economic regulation, and gradual reform. Despite strong electoral prospects for the 2003 Eduskunta elections, the SDP struggles to secure a majority coalition due to hesitancy from other parties. A right-wing coalition looms as a threat. The SDP must choose: reinforce core policies to boost voter support, revive the Red Soil coalition with the Centre Party for parliamentary strength, or confront right-wing parties to weaken their coalition potential."
NVGCfinland.29.a: "Bolster Core Support."
NVGCfinland.29.b: "Negotiate Red Soil Revival."
NVGCfinland.29.c: "Confront the Right."

NVGCfinland.30.t: "SAK Backs the SDP"
NVGCfinland.30.d: "The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) has launched a robust campaign supporting the Social Democrats, funding advertisements to promote worker-friendly policies. Their plan to enhance union influence promises to boost industrial efficiency."
NVGCfinland.30.a: "Excellent."

NVGCfinland.31.t: "Centre Party’s Strategic Vision"
NVGCfinland.31.d: "The Centre Party, rooted in its agrarian base, has become a formidable force championing Finnish sovereignty, decentralization, and rural prosperity. As the 2003 Eduskunta elections approach, the party must decide its path: align with the National Coalition for a patriotic capitalist coalition, revive the Red Soil government with the Social Democrats to bridge urban and rural interests, or form a centre-right coalition with the Christian Democrats to broaden its patriotic appeal beyond rural voters."
NVGCfinland.31.a: "Strike a balance with the National Coalition!"
NVGCfinland.31.b: "Ally with the SDP for Red Soil!"
NVGCfinland.31.c: "Strike the left with a Centre-Right coalition!"

NVGCfinland.32.t: "The Swedish Question"
NVGCfinland.32.d: "The Centre Party faces a pivotal decision on the status of Swedish-speaking Finns, who enjoy significant linguistic and cultural privileges, especially in Åland and coastal areas. With public debate intensifying, the party must choose whether to limit these rights to promote equality or maintain the status quo to preserve harmony."
NVGCfinland.32.a: "Limit Swedish privileges"
NVGCfinland.32.b: "Maintain the status quo"

NVGCfinland.34.t: "Denouncing Conservatism"
NVGCfinland.34.d: "The [Root.GetName] has been under the control of the false god of tradition and their lapdogs for years now, sowing the seeds of discontent and stifling the [Root.GetAdjective] people under the oppressive ideology of reactionary thought.\n\nThe state has taken it upon itself to remove conservative ideals from the nation, though this has displeased our more rural citizens, who are rather traditional in their thought and would prefer a conservative over a socialist government."
NVGCfinland.34.a: "They'll come around soon enough."

NVGCfinland.35.t: "Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland"
NVGCfinland.35.d: "The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, which had taken a stand against us since the [Root.GetAdjective] War of Independence, has been declared by the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Congress as an unnecessary institution.\n\nThe Communist Party, who have been given free reign (for the moment) in order to allow us to more easily initiate our directives, have begun purging members of the clergy. Of course, this has not endeared us to many of the more conservative people within [Root.GetName]."
NVGCfinland.35.a: "No matter."

NVGCfinland.36.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Constitution"
NVGCfinland.36.d.socialist: "In order to properly cement their power, the government have taken to drafting and ratifying a new constitution for [Root.GetName].\n\nAs it stands, the newly passed constitution provides for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] democracy, greater rights for the labour movement, a better–and more efficient–method of tax collection for the government, the furthering and support of the new regime’s ideological goals, and administrative restructuring in order to allow for a smoother transition to the new form of government.\n\nAlready, trade unions, now infinitely greater in terms of the power possessed, have begun to slowly take over and now make up the government. What this may hold for [Root.GetName], only the [GetRulingParty] and their close allies know..."
NVGCfinland.36.d.communist: "In order to properly cement their power, the Communist Party have taken to drafting and ratifying a new constitution for [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nAs it stands, the newly passed constitution provides for the centralisation of power in the hands of high ranking members of the Party, the complete restructuring of the [Root.GetAdjective] army and officer corps, the declaration of [Root.GetNameDef] as an atheist state, and the complete nationalization of any industries deemed necessary for the survival of the nation.\n\nAlready, the party members, now infinitely greater in terms of the power possessed, have begun to slowly take over and now make up the government. What this may hold for [Root.GetNameDef], only the Communist Party and their close allies know..."
NVGCfinland.36.a: "It seems Finland is entering a new era."

NVGCfinland.37.t: "The Left Alliance"
NVGCfinland.37.d: "The Left Alliance was founded by the Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL), the majority of members of the waning Communist Party of Finland (SKP) and the Finnish Women's Democratic League (SNDL). It was later joined by the communist Democratic Alternative. The founding meeting was held in April 1990 in Helsinki, following the publishing of the April Declaration, which stated the party's ideals.\n\nThe party's history has been characterised via internal disputes and bickering, as it was formed by people with very different views on society. There have been several defections from the Left Alliance to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Communist Party of Finland.\n\nNow in a position of power, the Alliance is prepared to enact its directives, which even includes the complete removal of the dangerous Communist Party, and set [Root.GetNameDef] on a new path..."
NVGCfinland.37.a: "We must stand firm in the face of opposition."

NVGCfinland.38.t: "Weakening the Communist Party"
NVGCfinland.38.d: "Even before we can attempt to disband the unruly and destructive Communist Party, we must take to weakening them in any way we can. This includes slowly reducing funding, blocking their agenda through legislative means, and setting up prominent leaders within the movement to take the fall. Most importantly, however, we must target their members and, through the use of subtle propaganda, convince them to leave the organisation.\n\nHowever Hannu Harju is a smart man, having been able to avoid imprisonment, unlike many communists before him. We must tread lightly, and hope that the Communist Party does not notice our attempts at weakening them..."
NVGCfinland.38.a: "Slowly, but surely, we're weakening the Communist Party."
NVGCfinland.38.b: "The Communist Party has caught on!"

NVGCfinland.39.t: "Showdown with the Communist Party"
NVGCfinland.39.d: "By now, all pretenses of any sort of covert operations against the Communist Party have been done away with, following the Communist Party’s discovery of our attempts to weaken them. A showdown between the Alliance and the Communist Party is under way, with the Communist Party quickly approaching in an attempt to storm parliament and declare the creation of a new [Root.GetAdjective] state. We must depend on the people to save us from the radicalism of the Communist Party, and allow for the continuation of a peaceful [Root.GetAdjective] state."
NVGCfinland.39.a: "The people have sided with us, ousting the Communist Party!"
NVGCfinland.39.b: "The Communist Party has seized power!"

NVGCfinland.40.t: "Disbanding the Communist Party"
NVGCfinland.40.d: "Due to our success at weakening the Communist Party, it seems as though completely disbanding the party should be rather easy. However, we still run the risk of revolutionaries and more hardline members taking over parliament and declaring the creation of a new state. However, due to our propaganda efforts, we should have enough people on our side to resist and completely disband the destructive organisation once and for all."
NVGCfinland.40.a: "The Communist Party has been disbanded!"
NVGCfinland.40.b: "The Communist Party has seized power!"

NVGCfinland.41.t: "The Question of Capitalist Newspapers"
NVGCfinland.41.d: "In order to prevent and reverse the current indoctrination of the [Root.GetAdjective] people under the capitalist system, while also building support for the current regime, we must ban all capitalist and/or counter-revolutionary papers. Of course, this will not reflect well on us in the short term due to our willingness, in the eyes of the people, to erode the freedom of press, but it is necessary to ensure the stability of [Root.GetName]."
NVGCfinland.41.a: "We cannot halt now."

NVGCfinland.42.t: "Tax Collection"
NVGCfinland.42.d: "One of the biggest issues on part of the [Root.GetAdjective] People’s Congress, which had also been a prevalent issue throughout the Rainbow Government’s collapse, was the lack of proper tax collection on behalf of our government. In order to allow for the various functions of the government to run properly and receive sufficient funding, we must enforce tax collection from our citizens. While this will not endear us any further to the [Root.GetAdjective] citizenry, it is something that must be done."
NVGCfinland.42.a: "Better to get it over with now."

NVGCfinland.43.t: "The Communist Party"
NVGCfinland.43.d: "In its 1993 party congress (August 28–29), the Communist Party of Finland (Unity), better known domestically as SKPy, oriented towards founding a new officially registered communist party and drafting of a new party program. A new party logo was also introduced to mark renewal. It was suggested that a congress to continue SKP's work should be held and that happened next year (November 26–27). In the congress, the suffix 'unity' was dropped from the name as SKPy now considered to consist of all those comrades who wanted to have an independent communist party. An athletic club was made the basis of new organization and renamed SKP. The decision split the party as some supporters would have preferred SKP to have a lesser role as 'Marxist forum' of some kind. Leadership of Left Alliance was also not pleased with those plans. SKP would have wanted to stay inside LA but that wasn't possible and the parties split in the spring of 1994. SKP wasn't however 're-registered' until 1997. There was some confusion, as the new SKP didn't accept responsibility for debts of the old one, which had gone bankrupt."
NVGCfinland.43.a: "We shall bring greatness to Finland!"

NVGCfinland.44.t: "The Second Red Terror"
NVGCfinland.44.d: "In order to crush all dissent from opposing figures, political parties, or newspapers, the Communist Party has taken to imprisoning, trying, and executing various counter-revolutionaries and ideological enemies of the state. While this will allow for us to better consolidate our power over the fearful people, who, for now, know not to oppose us, this will have painful ramifications on the functions of the state as many of our leading figures have been removed from power."
NVGCfinland.44.a: "So be it."

NVGCfinland.45.t: "Expanding the Bureaucracy"
NVGCfinland.45.d: "So as to allow for the centralisation of power under the new regime alongside a greater hold on power by the Communist Party, Hannu Harju has seen fit to expand the [Root.GetAdjective] bureaucracy and staff it with civil servants who are willing to carry out the directives of the new government.\n\nWhile this has harmed our standing with the farmers, who would rather see greater representation for rural Finland, this has increased our standing with the urban [Root.GetAdjective] population, who are content with the fact that the government will be receptive to their needs."
NVGCfinland.45.a: "You win some, you lose some."

NVGCfinland.46.t: "The Question of Private Assets"
NVGCfinland.46.d: "It is important that we turn our attention towards the bourgeoisie institutions within [Root.GetNameDef], such as the various banks within the nation, industrial conglomerates, and other profitable financial institutions.\n\nAllowing for the government to properly function while also ensuring that we have money on hand to help carry out our directives is key. Thus, we must take to seizing private assets from the wealthiest individuals."
NVGCfinland.46.a: "I'm sure they won't mind."

NVGCfinland.48.t: "The Question of the Military High Command"
NVGCfinland.48.d: "The question of the military high command has been a very prevalent discussion between various members of the Nordic Resistance Movement. As the issue of the remnants of the European presence in [Root.GetName] and its eventual removal has always been a goal of the Nordic Resistance Movement, it is only natural, to many, that members of the military high command who have shown loyalties to the EU should be removed from their positions within the military. However, Klas Lund is not a supporter of such a purge and argues that getting rid of the military’s best men would only weaken the state of the [Root.GetAdjective] Army.\n\nWith this in mind, the best course of action would be to..."
NVGCfinland.48.a: "Purge any and all traitors!"
NVGCfinland.48.b: "Allow the men to remain in power."

NVGCfinland.49.t: "Purging Globalists"
NVGCfinland.49.d: "In order to solidify our control over [Root.GetName] and prevent any dissent against our rule, we must take to purging any and all globalists. We have even gone as far as purging anybody who is sympathetic towards the globalist platform. This has provided us with the stability needed to continue running the nation without further obstacles."
NVGCfinland.49.a: "Wonderful!"

NVGCfinland.50.t: "The Role of the Clergy"
NVGCfinland.50.d: "For the longest time, among [Root.GetName]’s conservative population, the clergymen have been one of the biggest opponents of the Nordic Resistance Movement, having spoken against our cause, thus holding back potential popular support. Many of our moderate sympathizers remain close to the Church of Finland, and so abolishing it would turn these allies against us. We must instead align the clergy to our ideas, and change their role in the new [Root.GetAdjective] state."
NVGCfinland.50.a: "It is only natural that we change their role."

NVGCfinland.51.t: "Abolition of Parliament"
NVGCfinland.51.d: "Rather than a parliament to lead the [Root.GetAdjective] nation to greatness, what is in fact needed is a strong executive who will work in the interests of both the nation and the people. Political parties and members of parliament are inherently self-serving and cannot save the [Root.GetAdjective] nation from destruction, as seen by the Rainbow Government's Collapse. We must abolish the parliament at once and swiftly begin to carry out our directives."
NVGCfinland.51.a: "Such an institution is corrupt to the very core..."

NVGCfinland.52.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Has Remilitarized the Åland Islands!"
NVGCfinland.52.d: "It seems as though the nationalist [FIN.GetAdjective] has done what we’d feared: namely, the remilitarization of the Åland Islands. Previous governments had agreed to respect the rights of the [Root.GetName] citizens in the area. Unfortunately, the Nordic Resistance Movement have reneged on that promise, remilitarizing the island and silencing any dissent.\n\nWhile many of our more nationalist citizens are clamouring for us to declare war on [FIN.GetName] and take by the islands by military force, moderate politicians argue that we should use diplomacy to take back the islands. What should we do?"
NVGCfinland.52.a: "Declare war!"
NVGCfinland.52.b: "Diplomatic pressure would be preferable."

NVGCfinland.53.t: "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] Demands the Åland Islands"
NVGCfinland.53.d: "The [SWE.GetAdjective] government have seen fit to lodge a diplomatic protest with regards to our remilitarization of the Åland Islands, demanding we return the islands, which are populated by Swedes, and allow for its inhabitants to reunite with their [Root.GetAdjective] brethren."
NVGCfinland.53.a: "What a laughable proposition."

NVGCfinland.54.t: "National Coalition’s Strategic Crossroads"
NVGCfinland.54.d: "As Finland’s leading right-wing force since independence, the National Coalition (Kokoomus) champions liberal economic reforms, international trade, and a pro-NATO stance. Its alliance with the Swedish People’s Party, vital for forming governments, has softened its traditional policies to protect Swedish-speaking interests. Facing the 2003 Eduskunta elections, the Kokoomus must choose: maintain its core voter base with a focus on capitalism and globalism, align with the Christian Democrats to bolster conservative support, or confront the Social Democrats and Centre Party to undermine a potential grand coalition."
NVGCfinland.54.a: "Stay the course."
NVGCfinland.54.b: "Align with Christian Democrats."
NVGCfinland.54.c: "Confront the Left!"

NVGCfinland.55.t: "Monolingualism"
NVGCfinland.55.d: "One of the big questions on the minds of the [Root.GetAdjective] people and, indeed, the politicians of the Deep Blue Coalition is the question of what [Root.GetNameDef]’s official language and the issue of monolingualism. While the [SWE.GetAdjective] language is most popular throughout Åland, coastal communities within southern and eastern Finland also contain many [SWE.GetAdjective] speakers.\n\nHaving made up their minds, the politicians within the Deep Blue Coalition have decided to officially opt [Root.GetAdjective] as the official language of [Root.GetNameDef]."
NVGCfinland.55.a: "This will allow for greater uniformity."

NVGCfinland.56.t: "Åland’s Discontent"
NVGCfinland.56.d: "The decision to prioritize Finnish as the sole language has sparked outrage in Åland, where citizens feel their cultural identity is under threat. This has damaged Finland’s carefully built relationship with Åland, with many residents now advocating to join Sweden."
NVGCfinland.56.a: "Hopefully they endure this change."

NVGCfinland.59.t: "Expanding SUPO"
NVGCfinland.59.d: "It is clear that we must take to expanding the role of the Security and Intelligence Service, so as to allow the detection of activities deemed as stirring up dissent and, hopefully, end such activities before they can take hold on the nation and gain widespread influence amongst the people.\n\nAs such, Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has seen fit to increase the budget and powers of SUPO while also delegating day to day matters to intelligence ministers within his cabinet. The increase in funding has allowed for the investigation office of SUPO to employ a greater amount of employees while also allowing them to test out new methods to deal with any sort of dissidents and protect [Root.GetNameDef]’s internal security. This has, unfortunately, not been popular with large segments of the population, who view the measure as both excessive and authoritarian..."
NVGCfinland.59.a: "It is for the greater good."

NVGCfinland.60.t: "Stabilizing [Root.GetNameDef]"
NVGCfinland.60.d: "Despite having managed to successfully take and consolidate power, for now, it is clear that Kurvinen has much to do with regards to the stability of the nation. While the radicals on both the left and the right no longer pose a credible threat, the [Root.GetAdjective] people remain unsure about the new government and its goals for [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nIn order to clear up most of the uncertainty, Kurvinen has openly stated that his goal is to bring back stability to [Root.GetNameDef] while ensuring both peace and prosperity for the nation."
NVGCfinland.60.a: "Admirable."

NVGCfinland.61.t: "The New Constitution of [Root.GetNameDef]"
NVGCfinland.61.d: "Working tirelessly with several former and current government officials, legal and constitutional experts, and members of his inner circle, Kurvinen has been working on the creation for a new [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, so as to lay the foundation for a solid and stable [Root.GetNameDef].\n\nThe revised constitution reinforces the separation of powers and codifies clear procedures for emergency governance, guaranteeing the military’s neutrality and defining strict limits on executive authority during crises. It introduces mechanisms to prevent governmental paralysis, strengthens civic oversight of political parties, and enshrines new protections for transparency and national security.\n\nWith so many experts having written the constitution, and the [Root.GetAdjective] people in favor of legitimizing [Root.GetNameDef]’s newfound status in the world, it is no surprise that, earlier today, the constitution passed with flying colors, with parliament unanimously ratifying it. It’s effects, however, remain to be seen..."
NVGCfinland.61.a: "Wonderful!"

NVGCfinland.62.t: "Unifying the People"
NVGCfinland.62.d: "So as to not allow our efforts to go to waste, it is key that we bridge the gaps left over by the Rainbow Collapse alongside coercing the [Root.GetAdjective] people to put aside their ideological differences in order to truly come together and make [Root.GetNameDef] a great and prosperous nation. While the task of doing so is certainly one that requires dedication and compassion, it is clear that Kurvinen embodies those traits and wishes to empower the nation and its people."
NVGCfinland.62.a: "We must go forth, with our heads held high."

NVGCfinland.63.t: "[FIN.GetNameDef] Pursues Ties"
NVGCfinland.63.d: "In order to garner worldwide support for their newfound military government, it seems as though the [FIN.GetAdjective] government under [FIN.GetLeader] has pushed for establishing ties with our nation. Having sent diplomats on behalf of the [FIN.GetAdjective] state and petitioning us to recognise the new government, it seems as though, ultimately, the choice is up to us with regards to how this situation should be approached."
NVGCfinland.63.a: "We shall formally recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."
NVGCfinland.63.b: "We shall decline to recognise the [FIN.GetAdjective] state."

NVGCfinland.64.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
NVGCfinland.64.d: "Thankfully, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been kind enough to recognise our government as legitimate and we have already begun to open up diplomatic channels so as to formally establish ties."
NVGCfinland.64.a: "Wonderful!"

NVGCfinland.65.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
NVGCfinland.65.d: "It seems as though [FROM.GetNameDef] has snubbed us, refusing to establish formal ties with our nation, least of all recognise [Root.GetAdjective] legitimacy."
NVGCfinland.65.a: "Curse them!"

NVGCfinland.76.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Requests Aircraft Purchase"
NVGCfinland.76.d: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] seeks to bolster its air force by purchasing advanced aircraft. The [FIN.GetAdjective] delegation has approached us, requesting access to our latest plane designs. While this could strain our production or strategic reserves, the deal promises significant economic and diplomatic benefits. What is our response?"
NVGCfinland.76.a: "Approve the Sale - Strengthen Our Alliance"
NVGCfinland.76.b: "Decline the Request - Prioritize Our Needs"

NVGCfinland.77.t: "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] Approves Aircraft Sale!"
NVGCfinland.77.d: "Excellent news from the [SWE.GetAdjective] delegation: they have agreed to sell us advanced aircraft, including modern fighters and tactical bombers. This acquisition, facilitated by Patria’s integration expertise, will significantly strengthen the [FIN.GetAdjective] Air Force, ensuring our skies are well-defended.  "
NVGCfinland.77.a: "A triumph for our Air Force!"

NVGCfinland.78.t: "[SWE.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Aircraft Sale"
NVGCfinland.78.d: "Disappointing news from the [SWE.GetAdjective] delegation: they have declined our request to purchase aircraft, citing their own strategic priorities. The [FIN.GetAdjective] Air Force must now explore alternative means to enhance our aerial capabilities, potentially relying on domestic innovation."
NVGCfinland.78.a: "A setback, but we’ll persevere"

NVGCfinland.81.a: "A setback, but we’ll persevere"

NVGCfinland.83.t: "[FIN.GetName] wishes to trade"
NVGCfinland.83.d: "The [FIN.GetAdjective] government has approached us so as to procure resource shipments, as their old suppliers in the European Union are no longer a viable option for the nation. While it is true that we posses an abundance of resources, the question of whether or not we even wish to assist the Finns is still one that we must ask ourselves."
NVGCfinland.83.a: "We shall sell them - what could go wrong?"
NVGCfinland.83.b: "The costs outweigh the benefits - we shall decline."

NVGCfinland.84.t: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has agreed!"
NVGCfinland.84.d: "Good news has arrived from the [SOV.GetAdjective] delegation: they have agreed to supply us with the necessary resources, in exchange for an annual sum to offset the shipment fee, plus a bit extra. Thankfully, it seems we can avoid a resource shortage."
NVGCfinland.84.a: "Outstanding!"

NVGCfinland.85.t: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has declined."
NVGCfinland.85.d: "Horrible news has arrived from the [SOV.GetAdjective] delegation: they have have declined to supply us with the necessary resources, citing strained relations between our nations alongside domestic issues. Unfortunately, it seems that our population will have to endure for a certain time until we can find a way to offset the resource shortage."
NVGCfinland.85.a: "Most unfortunate."

NVGCfinland.91.t: "[FIN.GetName] wishes to trade"
NVGCfinland.91.d: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] has approached us regarding the procurement of resources, due to their lack of the raw materials. Due to financial constraints during the 1990s, we had originally, to the detriment of the [FIN.GetAdjective], been forced to lower imports, stranding the nation from important resources it cannot extract on its own. However, our economy has recovered since then, and it seems that we can began exporting once more. Then again, it is also true that conserving resources for [Root.GetAdjective]s at home would also be wise so as to combat any other potential future crises. What shall we do?"
NVGCfinland.91.a: "We shall sell the grain - what could go wrong?"
NVGCfinland.91.b: "The costs outweigh the benefits - we shall decline."

NVGCfinland.92.t: "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has agreed!"
NVGCfinland.92.d: "Good news has arrived from the [GER.GetAdjective] delegation: they have agreed to supply us with the necessary resources, in exchange for an annual sum to offset the shipment fee, plus a bit extra. Thankfully, it seems we can avoid a resource shortage."

Unfortunately, it seems that our population will have to endure for a certain time until we can find a way to offset the resource shortage."
NVGCfinland.93.a: "Most unfortunate."

NVGCfinland.95.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Seeks De-escalation"
NVGCfinland.95.d: "In a move that has surprised many within our foreign policy establishment, [FIN.GetNameDef] has formally approached us with a proposal to stabilize bilateral relations and reduce tensions along our shared border. Their stated goal is to prevent escalation in Northern Europe and establish a predictable security relationship.\n\nWhile cooperation could eliminate a potential flashpoint and free up strategic attention elsewhere, [FIN.GetNameDef] remains significantly weaker than us and vulnerable to pressure. We must decide how to respond."
NVGCfinland.95.a: "Accept — but on our terms."
NVGCfinland.95.b: "Accept and formalize relations through a treaty."
NVGCfinland.95.c: "Reject their proposal outright."

NVGCfinland.96.t: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Responds"
NVGCfinland.96.d: "Our diplomatic mission in Moscow has returned with a response. [SOV.GetNameDef] is willing to stabilize relations and reduce tensions — but only if we grant them military access to Finnish territory, allegedly to “ensure regional security.”\n\nSuch a concession would be deeply unpopular and raise serious concerns about our sovereignty. Yet refusing risks provoking a hostile response from a far stronger neighbor."
NVGCfinland.96.d2: "Our diplomats have returned with encouraging news: [SOV.GetNameDef] has agreed to pursue a formal treaty aimed at stabilizing relations and reducing the risk of conflict along our eastern border. While tensions remain, this marks a rare moment of diplomatic success."
NVGCfinland.96.a: "Reluctantly accept — stability comes at a price."
NVGCfinland.96.b: "Absolutely not! Finnish sovereignty is non-negotiable!"
NVGCfinland.96.c: "A welcome development."

NVGCfinland.97.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Our Terms"
NVGCfinland.97.d: "Despite presenting our conditions as necessary for regional stability, the Finnish government has rejected our proposal and refused further concessions. Their rhetoric of peace clearly has limits.\n\nIf [FIN.GetNameDef] wishes to gamble with its security, that is its choice."
NVGCfinland.97.a: "So be it."

NVGCfinland.98.t: "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Our Proposal"
NVGCfinland.98.d: "Our diplomatic initiative has failed. Russian officials have dismissed our proposal, signaling that they see no benefit in easing tensions with Finland at this time.\n\nWe must now accept the reality of a hostile and unpredictable neighbor to the east — and prepare accordingly."
NVGCfinland.98.a: "Then we must be ready..."

NVGCfinland.99.t: "[FIN.GetNameDefCap] Proposes Closer Cooperation"
NVGCfinland.99.d: "The [FIN.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a proposal to deepen bilateral cooperation, citing the importance of stability, coordination, and mutual trust in Northern Europe and the Baltic region.\n\nWhile relations between our countries are already positive, accepting this initiative would signal a stronger commitment to regional alignment. We must decide whether to formalize closer ties or maintain the status quo."
NVGCfinland.99.a: "Accept the proposal."
NVGCfinland.99.b: "Decline — current relations are sufficient."

NVGCfinland.100.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Cooperation"
NVGCfinland.100.d: "Excellent news. [From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to deepen cooperation with us, emphasizing shared regional interests and the importance of a stable Northern Europe. This agreement strengthens diplomatic trust and reinforces [FIN.GetNameDef]'s position among its neighbors."
NVGCfinland.100.a: "To continued cooperation."

NVGCfinland.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines"
NVGCfinland.101.d: "Unfortunately, [From.GetNameDef] has declined our proposal, stating that while relations remain cordial, they see no need to formalize closer cooperation at this time.\n\nThough disappointing, this does not mark a deterioration in relations — merely a missed opportunity."
NVGCfinland.101.a: "So be it."

NVGCfinland.108.t: "Ending the Fight?"
NVGCfinland.108.d: "Seeing as we have accomplished all our objectives in Sweden, having captured Lappland, perhaps it is time we petition them for a white peace."
NVGCfinland.108.a: "Yes - it is time we end the fight."
NVGCfinland.108.b: "No - we shall continue until we can claim total victory!"

NVGCfinland.109.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wishes for Peace"
NVGCfinland.109.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] have expressed their willingness to formally sign a treaty and declare peace between our two nations, provided we recognise their territorial gains. What say we?"
NVGCfinland.109.a: "Yes - we can no longer continue the fight."
NVGCfinland.109.b: "No - we shall never surrender!"

NVGCfinland.110.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Is Continuing the Fight"
NVGCfinland.110.d: "Foolishly enough, it seems as though the [From.GetAdjective] are intent on continuing the fight."
NVGCfinland.110.a: "So be it."

NVGCfinland.111.t: "Ending the Fight?"
NVGCfinland.111.d: "Seeing as we have accomplished all our objectives in Norway, having captured Nord-Norge, perhaps it is time we petition them for a white peace."

NVGCfinland.113.a: "So be it."

NVGCfinland.114.t: "Ending the Fight?"
NVGCfinland.114.d: "We've taken control of all core [Root.GetAdjective] lands in Russia, but the fight rages on. Perhaps we should offer the battered Russians peace in exchange for recognition of Finnish sovereignty over these newly acquired lands."
NVGCfinland.114.a: "Yes - it is time we end the fight."
NVGCfinland.114.b: "No - we shall continue until we can claim total victory!"

NVGCfinland.117.t: "Finland Petitions to Join the [SWE.GetFactionName]"
NVGCfinland.117.d: "Finland has been watching the formation of the [SWE.GetFactionName], and sees merit in joining the alliance for our joint defence and to deter hostile nations that do not subscribe to our common values from meddling with the region."
NVGCfinland.117.a: "Another Nordic nation joins the group!"
NVGCfinland.117.b: "They would merely be a burden to protect."

NVGCfinland.118.d: "We have received word from our embassy that the [From.GetAdjective] governments have accepted our petition to join the [SWE.GetFactionName] in favour of our joint defence!"
NVGCfinland.118.a: "We stand together against tyranny!"

NVGCfinland.119.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Us"
NVGCfinland.119.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government sees nothing in our proposal to stand together in alliance. It seems that we are on our own."
NVGCfinland.119.a: "We shall have to defend ourselves then!"

NVGCfinland.120.t: "Finland Wants to Join the Shanghai Pact"
NVGCfinland.120.d: "The socialist government of Finland has petitioned us expressing their desire to join the struggle for the world revolution. Shall we crush the bourgeoisie together with the Finnish worker?"
NVGCfinland.120.a: "Of course!"
NVGCfinland.120.b: "We have to decline."

NVGCfinland.121.t: "The Shangai Pact Accepts!"
NVGCfinland.121.d: "We have received word from the Shangai Pact that we are welcome in the struggle against the forces of reaction and the dark forces of financial capitalism. Together we shall crush the bourgeois pigdogs!"

NVGCfinland.128.d: "Today, Tarja Halonen has been sworn in as Finland’s new President, marking the end of Martti Ahtisaari’s distinguished tenure. Elected with strong Social Democratic support, Halonen’s leadership promises to advance progressive values and national unity. As Ahtisaari steps down, his legacy of diplomacy and stability paves the way for Halonen’s presidency."
NVGCfinland.128.a: "Welcome President Halonen"

NVGCfinland.130.t: "Finland Seeks Strategic Alignment"
NVGCfinland.130.d: "Following a period of domestic turmoil, Finland’s new conservative government has begun to reorient its foreign policy. Citing shared economic interests, security concerns in Northern Europe, and a long history of cooperation, Helsinki has discreetly approached Berlin with a proposal for closer strategic alignment.\n\nWhile Finland is not a major power, its geographic position, military competence, and political shift make it a potentially valuable partner in Northern Europe. Accepting Finland into our alliance could strengthen our influence in the Baltic and Nordic regions — though it may also complicate our relations with other powers.\n\nHow shall we respond to Finland’s request?"
NVGCfinland.130.a: "Finland is a natural partner — welcome them."
NVGCfinland.130.b: "We have no need for Finnish entanglements."

NVGCfinland.131.t: "Germany Declines Alignment"
NVGCfinland.131.d: "Despite our overtures, the German government has declined to pursue a formal strategic alignment. Whether due to internal divisions, broader geopolitical calculations, or concerns over Finland’s recent instability, Berlin has chosen to keep its distance.\n\nThe rejection leaves Finland in an awkward position. While our government remains committed to a conservative and nationalist course, the absence of German backing forces us to reconsider our place in Europe and seek alternative guarantees for our security."
NVGCfinland.131.a: "Then we shall stand on our own."

NVGCfinland.132.t: "Germany Accepts Our Proposal"
NVGCfinland.132.d: "Our diplomatic outreach to Berlin has borne fruit. The German government has agreed to formalize closer ties, recognizing Finland as a reliable partner in a changing European security environment.\n\nWith our accession to [GER.GetFactionName], Finland gains powerful allies and a clearer place in the emerging balance of power. While some question the long-term consequences of alignment with a German-led bloc, the government maintains that this partnership will ensure Finland’s security and economic stability in an uncertain world."
NVGCfinland.132.a: "Finland does not stand alone."

NVGCfinland.133.t: "Finland Wants to Join Our Faction"
NVGCfinland.133.d: "The government of Finland has petitioned us expressing their desire to join our vision for a just world. Shall we reshape history together with the Finnish people?"
NVGCfinland.133.a: "They should renounce their claims on Karelia then!"

NVGCfinland.134.t: "Russia Accepts!"
NVGCfinland.134.d: "We have received word from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government that we are welcome in the struggle against the forces of darkness and treachery. Together we shall crush our enemies!"

NVGCfinland.135.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective]s have let us know that we are not welcome on the battlefield against enemy forces. Apparently they consider us just another front that will not be held."

NVGCfinland.136.t: "Russia Demands We Renounce Claims on Karelia"
NVGCfinland.136.d: "Russia has demanded that we should renounce claims on Karelia so our countries can enter an alliance and peacefully co-exist. With a friendly regime in Russia it seems that this is no more a problem and Karelian people are safe."
NVGCfinland.136.a: "Sure."
NVGCfinland.136.b: "Karelia is rightful Finnish land!"

NVGCfinland.137.t: "Finland Accepted!"
NVGCfinland.137.d: "Finland has accepted our terms and renounced its claims on Karelia. Now we can formally establish an alliance."
NVGCfinland.137.a: "Splendid!"

NVGCfinland.138.t: "Finland Refused!"
NVGCfinland.138.d: "Finland has refused to renounce its claims on Karelia. While they act as rabid nationalists there is no sense in cooperating with such a regime."
NVGCfinland.138.a: "Their loss."

NVGCfinland.140.t: "Elections to the Finnish People's Congress"
NVGCfinland.140.d: "The Finnish People's Congress or Suomen Kansankongressi has been established soon after our young socialist republic was stabilized. With a clear reference to the governmental body, the People's Delegation is to become the new democratic socialist parliament of our state, and with the elections to the Trade Unions and Councils began a week ago, the government is ready to announce the results and a new composition of the government."
NVGCfinland.140.a: "The ideas of progressive environmentalism have not yet outlived their usefulness!"
NVGCfinland.140.b: "We must seek the true socialist model."

NVGCfinland.141.t: "Backlash to Market Reforms"
NVGCfinland.141.d: "The National Coalition’s pro-market policies have sparked outrage among left-wing factions. In protest, the Social Democrats and Left Alliance have drifted further left, announcing plans to form a coalition in the next election to counter our reforms."
NVGCfinland.141.a: "Press onward with the reforms."

NVGCfinland.143.t: "Liberal Coalition Forms Against Us"
NVGCfinland.143.d: "The Green League’s landslide victory has united the Centre Party and National Coalition in a liberal centrist alliance to oppose our progressive agenda. The Centre Party now blocks all left-wing legislation until our coalition dissolves, while the National Coalition adopts populist rhetoric, shifting rightward to appeal to all social strata, embracing liberal-conservative ideas."
NVGCfinland.143.a: "Stand Firm Against the Backlash!"

NVGCfinland.144.t: "Finnish NATO Application"
NVGCfinland.144.d: "The Finnish government has formally requested NATO membership. With Russia’s proximity posing risks, accepting Finland could strengthen NATO’s northern flank but may provoke Moscow."
NVGCfinland.144.a: "Welcome Finland to NATO."
NVGCfinland.144.b: "Reject to avoid Russian tensions."

NVGCfinland.145.t: "NATO Rejection"
NVGCfinland.145.d: "The United States has rejected Finland’s NATO application, citing concerns over Russian retaliation. This setback challenges our security strategy."
NVGCfinland.145.a: "We must reassess our approach."

NVGCfinland.146.t: "Christian Democrats’ Electoral Strategy"
NVGCfinland.146.d: "Founded on May 6, 1958, the Christian Democrats (KD) draw strength from Finland’s conservative Christian base, bolstered by defectors from the National Coalition. Committed to Christianity, the KD faces challenges from societal secularization. To preserve traditional values, the party pushes conservative policies focused on social cohesion, anti-socialism, and moderate patriotism. As the 2003 Eduskunta elections approach, the KD must choose: form a centre-right coalition with the National Coalition and Centre Party, align with the National Coalition and the rising Finns Party for an anti-socialist centrist coalition, or target the Social Democratic Party to weaken its left-wing influence."
NVGCfinland.146.a: "Form Centre-Right Coalition."
NVGCfinland.146.b: "Anti-Socialist Centrist Coalition."
NVGCfinland.146.c: "Target the Social Democrats."

NVGCfinland.147.t: "The Question of Our Southern Brothers"
NVGCfinland.147.d: "Through the resolve of the Finnish people, our armies have reshaped the north. From the Scandinavian frontier to the Karelian Isthmus, lands long tied to Finnic history now stand united under Helsinki’s authority. The Karelians, Kven, and Sámi are no longer divided by borders imposed by foreign powers.\n\nYet the dream that carried us this far has never been limited to our current frontiers. To the south, Estonia remains exposed — a Finnic nation caught between larger powers, its sovereignty fragile in a hostile world. Many argue that only unification can guarantee its survival.\n\nOthers go further still. They claim Finland now bears a historic responsibility — to protect not just Estonians, but all Finno-Ugric peoples scattered across the north and east, from the forests of Russia to the plains of Central Europe.\n\nThe path ahead will define not just Finland’s borders, but its place in history."
NVGCfinland.147.a: "We march to save our Estonian brothers!"
NVGCfinland.147.b: "We shall take up the Finno-Ugric torch and unite the North."
NVGCfinland.147.c: "We shall take up the Finno-Ugric torch, including even Hungary."
NVGCfinland.147.e: "We should focus on preserving Greater Finland."

NVGCfinland.150.t: "The Passing of Johannes Virolainen"
NVGCfinland.150.d: "Johannes Virolainen, a towering figure in the Centre Party and one of Finland’s most enduring statesmen, has passed away. Born in rural Karelia, Virolainen rose from humble roots to embody continuity and calm. Entering Parliament in 1945, he served nearly five decades, holding key roles in agriculture, education, and foreign affairs. As Prime Minister from 1964 to 1966, he bridged urban-rural divides through reform. His cautious diplomacy preserved Finland’s neutrality, while his tenure as Speaker of Parliament set a standard for democratic decorum. Known for dialogue and compromise, Virolainen’s death marks the end of an era of measured politics. His absence signals a shift toward more dogmatic divisions, as parties vie for influence in a changing Finland."
NVGCfinland.150.a: "Let us honor his legacy."

NVGCfinland.151.t: "May Day 2000: Workers’ Solidarity"
NVGCfinland.151.d: "On May 1, 2000, Helsinki and Viipuri burst with vibrant banners and fervent demonstrations as Finns celebrate May Day, a historic symbol of workers’ solidarity. The Finnish left, led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has evolved from its revolutionary roots during independence to a dominant force shaping the nation’s establishment. Alongside the SDP, the Green League and Left Alliance have grown as significant progressive voices, advocating for social justice and environmental reform. Their collective achievements—securing workers’ rights, welfare programs, and labor protections—have transformed Finland, invigorating the labor movement. Yet, as May Day 2000 unfolds, the right-wing parties express discontent, wary of the left’s resurgent influence."
NVGCfinland.151.a: "Let us celebrate the workers' resilience."

NVGCfinland.153.t: "The Finns Party’s Fifth Anniversary"
NVGCfinland.153.d: "Today marks five years since the Finns Party's formation in 1995, emerging as a bold conservative force challenging Finland’s social democratic status quo. Born from the ashes of the Finnish Rural Party, the Finns Party champions nationalist values, skepticism of EU integration, and resistance to progressive policies. Led by figures like Timo Soini, the party is gaining traction among voters disillusioned with the Rainbow Government’s centrism, positioning itself as a populist alternative. This milestone underscores their growing influence, stirring unrest in the established political order."
NVGCfinland.153.a: "We have no choice but to acknowledge their rise."

NVGCfinland.155.t: "Gustav Hägglund Announces His Retirement!"
NVGCfinland.155.d: "General Gustav Hägglund, our esteemed Chief of Defence, has announced his retirement effective June 3, 2001, just before his 63rd birthday. Born to a Swedish-speaking Finnish family with a proud military heritage from the Second World War, Hägglund’s career began in 1960 as a graduate of the Finnish Cadet School. His journey was marked by rigorous training, international education, and operational assignments that forged his strategic vision.\n\nA defining moment came in the late 1980s as commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), where his calm resolve and diplomatic skill earned global respect. Rising through the ranks, Hägglund led brigades, served in the Ministry of Defence, and became Chief of Defence in 1994. His tenure transformed the Finnish Army into a modern, agile, and internationally cooperative force, respected at home and abroad. Amid rising tensions with Russia’s actions in Chechnya, Hägglund’s legacy of resilience endures.\n\nAs Hägglund prepares to step down, the Army faces a critical decision: who will serve as Chief of Army and shape our doctrine? Three distinguished officers stand ready: Ahti Kurvinen, champion of defensive resilience; Pasi Velimäki, master of artillery firepower; and Kim Jäämeri, expert in urban tactics."
NVGCfinland.155.a: "Contact Kurvinen – Our patriotic defender."
NVGCfinland.155.b: "Appoint Jäämeri – Our specialized future."
NVGCfinland.155.c: "Select Velimäki – Our artillery force."

NVGCfinland.158.t: "Nordic Resistance Movement's Shadow in Finland"
NVGCfinland.158.d: "Reports emerge of extreme right-wing activities in Finland, influenced by the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM), founded in Sweden in 1997 and Norway in 1998. While still nascent, these groups are spreading from their Nordic origins, raising alarms that the NRM may establish a Finnish branch. This neo-Nazi movement's infiltration threatens to erode social cohesion and fuel ideological drift toward far-right extremism."
NVGCfinland.158.a: "Monitor this threat."

NVGCfinland.159.t: "Security Decree Targets People's Houses"
NVGCfinland.159.d: "Following Prime Minister Lipponen’s downfall, interim Prime Minister Anne Holmlund’s cabinet issues a Security Oversight Decree targeting left-wing meeting places, accused of fostering Marxist agitation. The decree mandates police registration and monitoring of these gatherings, with powers to disband events or seize materials deemed destabilizing. Surveillance on communist-leaning groups intensifies, drawing praise from Finns Party and NRM supporters for restoring order. However, the SDP, civil liberties groups, and National Coalition moderates denounce it as an attack on democracy, sparking protests. The decree signals a shift toward heightened security over civil liberties."
NVGCfinland.159.a: "This precedent is necessary!"

NVGCfinland.160.t: "The Blue-White Resurgence"
NVGCfinland.160.d: "A new political force has emerged with unsettling speed: the Finnish People's Blue-Whites, or Suomen Kansan Sinivalkoiset (SKS). Officially led by Olavi Mäenpää, a long-serving Turku City Council member known for his nationalist rhetoric, the SKS is widely understood to be the spiritual successor to the Nordic Resistance Movement, rebranded and refocused for electoral legitimacy. Though the NRM’s leadership remains banned from holding office, their ideology echoes clearly through the SKS manifesto.\n\nThe party’s platform is defined by radical Finnish nationalism, calling for a monolingual state, a corporatist economic model, and a zero-tolerance policy toward communism and left-wing influence. The SKS positions itself not only as anti-immigration but also as culturally reactionary — its rhetoric heavy with references to “traditional Finnish values” and the moral authority of the church and countryside.\n\nIn a surprising twist, Timo Soini, former leader of the Finns Party and a shrewd political operator, has acted behind the scenes as a mediator, exploring a potential electoral alliance between the SKS and the broader nationalist right. While the SKS remains a radical faction, its ability to tap into discontent among farmers, students, middle-class professionals, and clergy has given it alarming traction. What was once a fringe ideology on the margins of Finnish politics now stands poised to return — not through the barrel of a gun, but through the ballot box."
NVGCfinland.160.a: "The wolves return in sheep's clothing!"

NVGCfinland.161.t: "Cracking Down on Marxist Influence"
NVGCfinland.161.d: "Amid ongoing unrest, the Holmlund government invokes the Domestic Security Statute to impose restrictions on Marxist factions within the Left Alliance and trade unions. Citing risks of foreign influence and revolutionary rhetoric, the decree enables surveillance, funding cuts, and activity restrictions on suspected groups. The Left Alliance, led by Suvi-Anne Siimes, faces intense scrutiny, with its organizing and campaigning curtailed. Union offices in Tampere, Jyväskylä, and Oulu face inspections and shutdowns. Siimes denounces the measures as a “witch hunt” to silence dissent, while the fractured Social Democrats offer tepid support. Conservatives hail the crackdown as a necessary purge of extremism."
NVGCfinland.161.a: "Let them struggle under scrutiny."
NVGCfinland.161.b: "We’re not finished until they’re broken!"

NVGCfinland.162.t: "The Nail in the Red Coffin"
NVGCfinland.162.d: "The Holmlund government has effectively and informally banned socialist parties from upcoming elections, escalating its crackdown on the Left Alliance, Communist Party, and parts of the Green League. Using expanded emergency powers, it freezes campaign funds, bans Marxist sub-organizations, and imposes eligibility rules disqualifying radical candidates. Political offices are shut down, assets seized, and members monitored, effectively dismantling these parties. The government claims this preserves national unity post-NRM Rebellion, securing a conservative victory. Exiled opposition leaders denounce it as an attack on democracy, but dissent within the government is muted."
NVGCfinland.162.a: "Welcome to your funeral. Isn't it so tragic?"

NVGCfinland.163.t: "The Badge Act"
NVGCfinland.163.d: "In response to the turbulent events the growing influence of political movements like the Nordic Resistance Movement, the Deep Blue Coalition government introduces the controversial 'Badge Act.' This legislative move, named after the distinctive symbols used by Nordic Resistance Movement members, is designed to exert control over the activities of political organizations deemed a threat to public order. The act imposes limitations on public gatherings, especially those organized by political groups using extremist symbolism. This includes increased scrutiny and regulation of events where such symbols are prevalent. Law enforcement agencies are granted additional powers to monitor and surveil groups that fall under the purview of the Badge Act. This includes keeping tabs on gatherings, speeches, and activities associated with the Nordic Resistance Movement.\n\nThe act is introduced as a temporary measure, with an initial period of validity until the end of 2007. However, the government reserves the right to extend this period if it deems the circumstances warrant such an extension. The rationale behind the 'Badge Act' lies in addressing public concerns about the rising influence of paramilitary groups like the Nordic Resistance Movement and communist paramilitaries, perceived as a threat to the democratic order. By restricting the public visibility of radical movements, the government aims to preserve public order and prevent the escalation of political tensions that could lead to violence. The act is also framed as a measure to curtail the activities of groups that might engage in extremist actions or pose a risk to the stability of the nation.\n\nPublic reaction to the 'Badge Act' is mixed. While some segments applaud the government's efforts to control potentially disruptive movements, others criticize it as an infringement on civil liberties. Opposition parties, particularly the SDP, strongly criticize the act as an attempt to stifle political dissent and curb the activities of groups that oppose the government. The Nordic Resistance Movement, directly affected by the act, condemns it as an unjust restriction on their right to political expression. Some members express defiance by continuing to bear distinctive symbolism despite the legal constraints."
NVGCfinland.163.a: "No more Nazi flags in public!"

NVGCfinland.164.t: "Ban of the SKS"
NVGCfinland.164.d: "The government now takes decisive action to address what it perceives as a growing threat from the SKS. Key measures implemented agsint the SKS includes: the government, utilizing the authority granted by constitution, officially bans the activities of the SKS. This includes public gatherings, political events, and any form of organizational activities conducted by the party. Law enforcement agencies are directed to take swift action against key figures within the SKS. Party leaders, prominent members, and individuals associated with the organization are to be arrested and detained based on the legal authority provided by Finnish law."
NVGCfinland.164.a: "Is this the final end of radicalism?"

NVGCfinland.165.t: "A Far-Right Endeavor"
NVGCfinland.165.d: "The Finnish far-right movement sees a new development with the formation of the Blue and White Front (Sinivalkoinen Rintama or SR). The SR is not a spontaneous creation but rather a result of calculated planning by the SKS and NRM leadership. Recognizing the need for alternative avenues and political platforms, they decide to establish the Blue and White Front to further their ideological goals. Its ideology revolves around a vision of a monolingual Finland, corporatist economics, and a staunch opposition to any perceived communist or socialist influence. The party maintains a clear continuity with the far-right ideologies of its predecessor. While the SR is officially formed, its initial influence on the political scene is relatively limited. The political climate, shaped by recent events and the actions of other political entities, poses challenges for a new far-right party to gain immediate traction. Observers suggest that the Blue and White Front faces considerable obstacles in terms of public support and electoral success in the near future. The recent political shifts and the dominance of established parties make it challenging for a new entrant, especially one associated with the far-right, to rise rapidly."
NVGCfinland.165.a: "Interesting..."

NVGCfinland.168.t: "A Goverment for All Finns"
NVGCfinland.168.d: "Following the defense of democracy, the Haatainen government unites the Social Democrats, Centre Party, and National Coalition to modernize Finland’s constitution. Building on Paavo Lipponen’s stalled reforms, this compromise balances ideological divides. The left secures civil liberties and labor rights but softens socialization plans. The right accepts limits on emergency powers and security agency politicization for economic liberalism. Centrists gain a streamlined parliamentary system with proportional elections and stronger budgetary oversight. Though no party achieves all its goals, this historic consensus, forged in crisis, signals a stable new era for Finland."
NVGCfinland.168.a: "Let this be the foundation of our future!"

NVGCfinland.170.t: "Justice in Turku"
NVGCfinland.170.d: "After the Nordic Resistance Movement’s failed rebellion, the Finns Party-led government pursues restrained legal action in the Turku Court of Appeal. 102 individuals face charges, with NRM leader Esa Henrik Holappa receiving a 15-month sentence for rebellion, citing proportional justice. Defected military personnel get one-year sentences with parole eligibility, while financial supporters receive suspended sentences and community service. Critics, especially from the left, decry the leniency as soft on extremism, but the government frames it as national healing."
NVGCfinland.170.d2: "Following the Nordic Resistance Movement’s rebellion, the government launches a robust judicial response in the Turku Court of Appeal. NRM leader Esa Henrik Holappa is sentenced to six years for inciting rebellion and conspiring against the state. Defected soldiers face three-year sentences and lifetime bans from state service, while financial backers receive one- to two-year terms. The open trials underscore the rule of law, earning public support as a stand for democracy, despite far-right criticism."
NVGCfinland.170.a: "No man may rise against Finland without consequence!"

NVGCfinland.171.t: "RKP Reconsiders Alliances"
NVGCfinland.171.d: "The Swedish People’s Party (RKP), a liberal party representing Finland’s Swedish-speaking minority, has historically aligned with the National Coalition to protect the rights of Swedish-speaking communities. However, the shifting political landscape, with the Centre Party’s rise and the growing presence of the right-wing Finns Party, forces RKP to reassess its strategy. They could maintain their traditional partnership with the National Coalition, explore coalition possibilities with the agrarian-focused Centre Party to secure influence, or—less conventionally—consider a government led by the Social Democrats, potentially supporting a third Lipponen term. As a small but pivotal party, RKP could leverage its position to tilt the coalition outcome in favor of policies protecting the Swedish-speaking minority"
NVGCfinland.171.a: "This is not the time to backstab the National Coalition."
NVGCfinland.171.b: "The stake is put on the Centre Party this election."
NVGCfinland.171.c: "Align SDP for federalization."

NVGCfinland.172.t: "Beaver Reckoning"
NVGCfinland.172.d: "Decades ago, in an ambitious yet ecologically naïve move, the Finnish government imported seven North American beavers alongside seventeen Eurasian beavers to repopulate the nation's dwindling beaver population. Hailed as a bold act of environmental restoration, the plan backfired: North American beavers, unable to interbreed with their Eurasian counterparts, proved highly adaptable and fertile — quickly spreading across the Finnish Lakeland. These ecological imposters now threaten native species and habitats, displacing the very beavers they were meant to help.\n\nAfter years of mounting concern among biologists, conservationists, and landowners, the government is finally taking decisive action. Effective immediately, North American beavers may be hunted freely during the beaver hunting season — no special license required. Officials hope this measure will control the invasive population and give the Eurasian beaver a fighting chance at reclaiming its ecological niche. Whether it's too late to reverse the damage remains to be seen."
NVGCfinland.172.a: "It’s open season on the invaders!"

NVGCfinlandNews.1.t: "Collapse of the Republic of Finland"
NVGCfinlandNews.1.d.intro: "No longer pressed between East and West as in the Cold War, Finland had emerged as a model of liberal democracy, firmly rooted in the European project. Yet behind this democratic veneer, tensions were rising. With the Rainbow Government paralyzed by internal division and the specter of political violence growing by the day, Finland’s post–Cold War stability has now come to a dramatic and possibly irreversible end."
NVGCfinlandNews.1.d.fascist: "$NVGCfinlandNews.0.d.intro$\n\nThe Nordic Resistance Movement, led by Esa Henrik Holappa, has seized control of Finland, proclaiming the establishment of the Unitary Republic of Finland after a successful March on Helsinki. Fiercely authoritarian, corporatist, and aggressively anti-globalist, the NRM’s ideology draws heavily from National Socialism and pan-Nordic nationalism. The new regime has begun purging liberal and socialist elements from public life, consolidating power through militarized police and nationalist paramilitary forces. The European Union has condemned the takeover, but Holappa has made it clear: 'Finland belongs to Finns, not Brussels.'"
NVGCfinlandNews.1.d.communist: "$NVGCfinlandNews.0.d.intro$\n\nAmidst brutal street fighting and the disintegration of the old order, a red banner now flies over Helsinki. The Communist Party of Finland, supported by radical wings of the Left Alliance, has emerged victorious in the chaos and declared the birth of a People’s Republic of Finland. The regime immediately announced its withdrawal from the European Union and NATO partnerships, calling them “imperialist structures.” With economic and diplomatic ties to the West severed, the new government is already reaching out to its ideological allies abroad for support and recognition."
NVGCfinlandNews.1.d.Kurvinen: "$NVGCfinlandNews.0.d.intro$\n\nAfter weeks of political paralysis and violence between extremist factions, the Finnish Defence Forces, under General Ahti Kurvinen, launched an emergency stabilization operation to prevent civil war, suspending parliament and assuming provisional control of the state, citing the inability of civilian leadership to restore order. Though Kurvinen claims this is only a temporary measure, opposition voices have gone silent, and political parties have been suspended. Whether democracy will return to Finland remains uncertain — but for now, the gun decides the law."
