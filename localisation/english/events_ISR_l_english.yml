 israel.1.t:0 "The Retreat from Lebanon"
 israel.1.d:0 "The Israeli retreat from Southern Lebanon, occupied since the Lebanese Civil War of 1982, had been long planned and, according to the United Nations, overdue. While internal support is split, knowing the soldiers' home will not hurt the Israeli people."
 israel.1.o1:0 "The boys are home."
 israel.2.t:0 "Negotiations over Golan"
 israel.2.d:0 "The Golan Heights have been occupied by Israeli forces since the Six Days War of 1967. The international community has put repeated pressure on us to at least negotiate over their return to Syria. While acceptance seems unlikely, at least sending a signal might be worthwhile. We should however not forget that Golan is an easily defendable position and heavily fortified. If we decide not to trust the Syrians, keeping the Golan Heights is the way to go."
 israel.2.o1:0 "Offer Syria to negotiate."
 israel.2.o2:0 "Negotiate with Assad? Never!"
 israel.3.t:0 "Israel offers to negotiate over Golan"
 israel.3.d:0 "The Israeli government has informed us that they are interested in sorting out the future of the Golan Heights diplomatically."
 israel.3.o1:0 "Let's see where this leads."
 israel.3.o2:0 "At a table with the zionists? Never!"
 israel.4.t:0 "Syria is willing to negotiate!"
 israel.4.d:0 "Syria has accepted our offer and is now awaiting an offer."
 israel.4.o1:0 "Offer them a military alliance in exchange for Golan."
 israel.4.o2:0 "A military cooperation should be sufficient."
 israel.5.t:0 "Israel offers alliance for Golan"
 israel.5.d:0 "'If Syria is willing to accept a permanent military alliance with Israel, as well as to recognize it as the rightful owner of its internationally recognized territory, we will retreat from Golan.' \nThe words of the Israeli Prime Minister were followed by a long pause. An alliance is an incredibly unpopular idea in Syria, but the opportunity to recover Golan peacefully and to gain a powerful ally like Israel might be too great to pass up."
 israel.5.o1:0 "A risky move, but indeed what might be necessary."
 israel.5.o2:0 "What?! Death is a preferable alternative to that!"
 israel.6.t:0 "Israel offers military cooperation"
 israel.6.d:0 "The voices in Israel demanding an unobtainable offer were quickly silenced and followed by a quite reasonable offer: Should the Syrian and Israeli forces agree to conduct common manoeuvres and to establish a constant communications channel, Israel is to retreat from Golan."
 israel.6.o1:0 "Sounds like a bargain!"
 israel.6.o2:0 "How about no?"

 israel.7.t:0 "Israel Remains in Lebanon"
 israel.7.d:0 "The Israeli government has chosen security over international pressure to withdraw from Lebanese territory. Some have claimed this will just be a temporary extension of the current occupation however official IDF sources have not commented on the exact nature of the continued presence."
 israel.7.o1:0 "Security is non-negotiable"
 israel.7.o2:0 "Outrageous"


 israel.8.t:0 "Israel demands Gaza Strip"
 israel.8.d:0 "Israel has sent us a demand for the Gaza Strip, hinting at aggression if we do not comply. While there would be public outrage, ceding the region may stop further conflict."
 israel.8.o1:0 "For the good of the people, we will surrender."
 israel.8.o2:0 "We will never accept the occupation! If this means war, so be it!"
 israel.9.t:0 "Israel issues ultimatum"
 israel.9.d:0 "Israel seems to not be satisfied with just Palestine and has now threatened our sovereignty using words. They have repeatedly cited a document created in 1919 by the World Zionist organisation claiming part of Jordan for Israeli rule, and they have mobilised a large portion of their armed forces to our border and combat preparations are finished. War seems on the horizon."
 israel.9.o:0 "We will prepare for war."
 israel.10.t:0 "Israel demands Sinai!"
 israel.10.d:0 "Israel has now demanded the Sinai! They say that it is rightful Israeli land, as it was captured in the infamous Six-Day War, and was later returned to us in the treaty of the war of 1973. Perhaps giving it to them will spare us of further bloodshed, but we must be careful. The Sinai is a vital buffer zone between our two countries. If we give it up and they decide to go to war with us in the future... They will be able to reach Cario in hours."
 israel.10.o1:0 "We will cede the Sinai."
 israel.10.o2:0 "We will never give in to Israeli demands!"
 israel.12.t:0 "Israel offers Union State"
 israel.12.d:0 "Relations between our two nations have softened, and now the Israelis have offered a union state. If we accept, we will maintain a portion of our sovereignty, but we will mostly be subject to Israeli rule. However, our people will have a voice in the government."
 israel.12.o1:0 "We accept!"
 israel.12.o2:0 "It isn't in our best interests."
 israel.13.t:0 "Israel requests full unification"
 israel.13.d:0 "Israel has now offered a full unification, where they will give all of our citizens Israeli citizenship. Our two nations would form a federation, much like the states in the US. Should we give up our sovereignty to end this conflict?"
 israel.13.o1:0 "Finally, there will be peace! We accept!"
 israel.13.o2:0 "We can't accept that."
 israel.14.t:0 "Israel offers alliance"
 israel.14.d:0 "Israel has offered numerous countries in the Middle East Region seats in a military alliance, and our nation is one of them. If we accept, the Middle East will be a powerful player on the world stage. Should we?"
 israel.14.o1:0 "Why not? Forward to glory!"
 israel.14.o2:0 "Ally with the Zionists!? Never!"
 israel.15.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts alliance proposal!"
 israel.15.d:0 "[From.GetName] has replied to our offer, and accepted!"
 israel.15.o1:0 "For peace in the Middle East!"
 israel.16.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects alliance proposal."
 israel.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has replied to our offer, and has informed us that an alliance is not in their best interests."
 israel.16.o1:0 "That is a shame."
 israel.18.t:0 "Rioting!"
 israel.18.d:0 "Following our new conscription policy, the Orthodox extremists have come out in the thousands to protest, which quickly escalated into riots. While we managed to restore order, thousands have died and there are reports of Jewish terror cells beginning to attack our industry."
 israel.18.o:0 "They will not break our spirit."
 israel.20.t:0 "Israel offers federation!"
 israel.20.d:0 "Relations between Israel and Jordan have warmed in recent years, and now Israeli officials have come to us offering a federation state, in which Israel and Jordan would become one. What should we do?"
 israel.20.o1:0 "We will be strong together!"
 israel.20.o2:0 "Such a deal is not in our best interests at this moment."
 israel.22.t:0 "The Jerusalem Accords"
 israel.22.d:0 "Israel has offered us a compromise where we would be given East Jerusalem, parts of Northern Israel, and regions neighbouring the Gaza Strip. We have been given the chance to almost completely return to the 1947 borders. Do we sign off?"
 israel.22.o1:0 "We would be a fool to reject that!"
 israel.22.o2:0 "Palestine is a friend of Israel. They can keep their land."
 israel.23.t:0 "Rockets launched from Palestine!"
 israel.23.d:0 "Palestine has launched rockets towards our civilian centres in Israel! The damage is still being assessed, in the meantime, we need to decide how to respond."
 israel.23.o1:0 "Send them a strongly worded letter."
 israel.23.o2:0 "Launch target strikes at suspected launch sites."
 israel.23.o3:0 "Time to send a message. Commence all-out bombardment of suspected sites."
 israel.24.t:0 "Rocket bases destroyed!"
 israel.24.d:0 "Satellite intel shows that the launch sites of the rockets have taken a direct hit with minimal civilian casualties. This is unlikely to draw diplomatic backlash."
 israel.24.o1:0 "Great news!"
 israel.25.t:0 "Rocket bases still operational."
 israel.25.d:0 "Satellite intel shows that the launch sites are still operational but managed to disperse to fight another day."
 israel.25.o1:0 "We should have done more."
 israel.26.t:0 "Large Civilians Casualties in Gaza"
 israel.26.d:0 "A few days ago Israel suffered rocket attacks from Gaza. Israel retaliated, causing moderate to severe civilian casualties. How should we respond to this?"
 israel.26.o1:0 "We will not support this. Embargo Israel."
 israel.26.o2:0 "Show Israel we do not approve but wish to maintain economic ties."
 israel.26.o3:0 "They were protecting themselves."
 israel.27.t:0 "Rockets base destroyed, severe civilian casualties."
 israel.27.d:0 "Satellite intel shows that the launch sites of the rockets have been destroyed following our bombardment, but many civilians were killed. This may draw diplomatic backlash..."
 israel.27.o1:0 "We didn't fire the first shot."

 israel.28.t:0 "Israel demands the West Bank"
 israel.28.d:0 "Israel has demanded our remaining land in the West Bank, if we don't comply we risk losing Gaza as well."
 israel.28.o1:0 "For the survival of our people, we must."
 israel.28.o2:0 "We will never succumb to Zionist demands!"

 news_ISR.1.t:0 "Israel refuses Golan negotiations"
 news_ISR.1.d:0 "Recent efforts by the United Nations to make Israel reconsider its occupation of the Golan Heights, ongoing since 1967, have been thwarted by the Israeli government, even after this very government had sent positive signals by retreating from South Lebanon at the end of May. The prime minister of Israel called Syria 'a dishonest haven for terrorism and viciousness' and a 'fundamental and never-ending threat to Israeli independence'. It is unlikely that these two nations will work out their differences any time soon."
 news_ISR.2.t:0 "Syria insults Israel over Golan deal"
 news_ISR.2.d:0 "After the Israeli government had approached the government of Syria over a possible return of the Golan Heights to Syrian administration, the Syrian government publicly declared that there would be no surrender in front of Israeli zionists and their evil schemes. 'Syria will rather abstain from gaining control over Golan than to recognize the Jewish parasite as a state' if a reaction of a Syrian government official is to be believed."
 news_ISR.3.t:0 "Golan negotiations successful"
 news_ISR.3.d1:0 "In a quite shocking turn of events, Syria and Israel have signed a military pact, the Levantine Alliance, after negotiations over the Golan Heights concluded. Neither the Israeli nor the Syrian people expected or even preferred that possibility, but now, a new military alliance and a new owner of the Golan Heights - Syria - forces the world to adapt to the new situation."

Jordan is the rightful territory of the Israeli people.". Following this announcement, the Israeli government has mobilised troops to the Israeli-Jordanian border in what seems to be a prelude to war.
