 argentina.1.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
 argentina.1.d:0 "Due to the economic crisis ravaging the nation, many Argentines, fearing an economic crash and possibly a devaluation, are transforming pesos to dollars and withdrawing them from the banks in large amounts, usually transferring them to foreign accounts, worsening the crisis. \n\nIn order to stop this draining from destroying the banking system, our economy minister is suggesting we freeze all bank accounts and only allow a small amount of money to be withdrawn per person weekly and only in pesos. \n\nHowever, other government members fear that this measure could worsen the political and social crisis caused by the recession."
 argentina.1.a:0 "We have no other options."
 argentina.1.b:0 "It is too risky"
 TT_ARG_CORRALITO:0 "§RThis will have consequences...§!"
 argentina.2.t:0 "The Argentinazo"
 argentina.2.d:0 "The people, tired of the economic crisis, and angry about our recent economic measures, have taken to the streets in anger. \n\nProtests and riots are being reported all over the nation, with violence being reported from both police and protesters. As the death toll continues rising, the nation awaits the reaction from the presidency."
 argentina.2.a:0 "We must declare a state of emergency."
 argentina.2.b:0 "Backtrack our reforms and make concessions to the protesters."
 argentina.3.t:0 "UCR with its support for [ARG.GetLeader]"
 argentina.3.d:0 "Following the increasing unrest and the rising death toll, the Unión Civica Radical, president [ARG.GetLeader]'s own party, has withdrawn its support of the government, with various ministers resigning. While De la Rúa planned to form a new government with support from the Peronist Justicialist Party, the chances of such negotiations being successful are slim, especially amid the current crisis. \nAs such, many think that the only option left for the president is resignation. If he does so, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate Federico Ramón Puerta will take over as president until Congress elects a new interim president, as De la Rúa's running mate Carlos Álvarez has already resigned in October 2000."
 argentina.3.a:0 "De la Rúa Resigns."
 argentina.3.b:0 "De la Rúa forms a new cabinet with PJ's support"
 argentina.3.c:0 "The president refuses to step down"
 argentina.4.t:0 "Adolfo Rodríguez Saá Takes Office"
 argentina.4.d:0 "Adolfo Rodríguez Saá has been elected by the senate and has taken office, to serve as interim president until the next elections. \nWhile Saá's main objective is to maintain stability in the country until the next elections can be held, he has ambitions to use his position as interim president to do popular reforms, seeking to end the crisis and to increase his own political standing."
 argentina.4.a:0 "Attempt the reforms"
 argentina.4.b:0 "It'll be better if we keep calm"
 argentina.4.b:0 "We must hold the country together first"
 argentina.5.t:0 "Sáa Resigns!"
 argentina.5.d:0 "Following the failure of his attempted reforms, further protests, a panic attack and citing lack of political support, even from his own party, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá has announced his resignation from the presidency. With Federico Ramón Puerta going absent to avoid assuming the office again, the presidency falls on the shoulders of Senator Eduardo Camaño until the legislative assembly can elect a new interim president."
 argentina.5.a:0 "These are troubling times."
 argentina.6.t:0 "Eduardo Duhalde Takes Office"
 argentina.6.d:0 "With 262 votes in favour, Eduardo Duhalde has been elected the new interim president until the next elections."
 argentina.6.a:0 "Good luck Duhalde."
 argentina.7.t:0 "Hold Early elections?"
 argentina.7.d:0 "[ARG.GetLeader]'s government seems to be more stable than the previous one. Still, while he was able to hold the presidency for more than a week, it's his and the rest of the government's consensus that the current crisis will only end once new elections are held. As such, it would be widely considered a wise decision to hold the elections that are scheduled to happen in October earlier this year, with a date around April being suggested."
 argentina.7.a:0 "That's a great idea!"
 argentina.7.a:0 "[ARG.GetLeader] will finish his term in due time"
 argentina.8.t:0 "The Death of Néstor Kirchner"
 argentina.8.d:0 "The Argentine Nation is in mourning as news of the sudden death of influential Peronist leader Néstor Kirchner spread. Kirchner was relatively young, at 60, and had always downplayed the seriousness of his heart problems, so news of his passing from a heart attack was shocking. Kirchner had radically changed the mainstream position of most Peronists in the Justicialist Party, adopting a leftist stance reminiscent of figures like former president Héctor Cámpora, and moving away from the neoliberal stance of Carlos Meném. \nHis body was flown to the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, where a state funeral was held, with thousands attending. Cristina Kirchner, his widow and apparent political successor, was standing next to the coffin dressed in mourning, and was reported personally accepting flowers from visitors."
 argentina.8.a:0 "May he rest in peace"
 argentina.9.t:0 "The Death of Ricardo Guillermo Brinzoni"
 argentina.9.d:0 "Army Chief of the General Staff, head of the National Reorganization Junta and president of Argentina, Ricardo Brinzoni, has died of pancreatic cancer in Buenos Aires, aged 60. Now, the ruling military junta has reconvened to name his successor. The two main possibilities are army general Rodrigo Soloaga, who rose in the ranks after the coup, or navy chief admiral Joaquín Edgardo Stella."

 argentina.10.t:0 "The Death of Fanny Edelman"
 argentina.10.d:0 "Historic leader of the Communist Party of Argentina Fanny Edelman, born Fanny Jabcovsky, has died at age 100. Born of an immigrant family who fled the anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire, Fanny fought with the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War, helped the International Red Aid (a Comintern version of the Red Cross), became general secretary of the Women's International Democratic Federation and has been president of the PCdeA since 1970."

 argentina_focus.1.t:0 "Fallout of the Argentinazo"
 argentina_focus.1.d:0 "The situation in Argentina has reached a breaking point. With President [ARG.GetLeader] stubborn refusal to resign or to significantly shift his policies to end the current crisis, the riots of the Argentinazo continue to grip the country. Amidst the increased radicalization of the protestors and piqueteiros, neighbourhood assemblies and mutual aid networks are being created, unused land and factories are being occupied, and workers' self-management is being implemented across hundreds of companies. \nThis poses a historic opportunity to any leftist force capable of rising to the leadership of the workers of Argentina, while posing a terrifying prospect to the Armed Forces, whose leaders have been seen in secretive meetings with business representatives, allegedly discussing the possibility of another military coup."

One of the most powerful people in the country he is however involved in numerous scandals, being involved with drug trafficking and being recently accused of brokering a shipment of 10,000 AK-pattern rifles to the communist guerrillas in Colombia, the FARC. The most recent crisis involving Montesinos seems to be the gravest, however. Peruvian television station Canal N has broadcasted a tape showing him bribing an opposition congressman to defect to the ruling Peru 2000 party.\nThis broadcast made support for Fujimori's collapse, and it's a consensus that Montesinos must resign. The fall of Montesinos would, however, result in the fall of one of the pillars of Fujimori's government, as, without him, the National Intelligence Service would dissolve.""

Now, staying in Japan after attending a summit in Brunei, Fujimori plans to fax a resignation to Congress. \nCongress, dominated by the opposition and people who still soundly remember the 1992 coup, will, however, likely refuse the resignation, deciding to remove Fujimori on their terms. This will probably be accompanied by a ban from Peruvian politics and criminal persecution. \n With this in mind, the alternative would be to return to Peru immediately and try to save the presidency whatever the cost."

 venezuela.3.d:0 "After the results of the 2018 presidential elections were put into question, the opposition-dominated National Assembly declared Maduro a usurper of the presidency and set in motion a plan to place its own president Juan Guaidó as the acting leader of the country. \nSeveral dozen military personnel and civilians joined Guaidó in his call for the removal of Nicolás Maduro, in of what he labeled "Operation Freedom". Many countries have also declared support for Guaidó and have called for Maduro's removal. \nHowever, truth be told, Juan Guaidó lacks major support in the military and in other institutions required to topple President Maduro, and his claim to the presidency is fragile at best."

 venezuela.4.d:0 "Venezuelan dissidents and US mercenaries led by Jordan Goudreau have plotted to infiltrate Venezuela by sea and forcibly remove Nicolás Maduro from power. Their plan, elaborated with the help of desertor drug-trafficking general Clíver Antonio Alcalá Cordones, was amateurish, poorly organized and borderline suicidal, as it ran into immediate problems, with some of their forces being intercepted and captured by unarmed fishermen."

 venezuela.5.d:0 "Holy shit, our plan worked. Caracas, and the dictator Maduro, are in our hands. Wow. Now, despite this, to say that our position is difficult would be like saying that shit isn't the tastiest meal in the World. true, but that doesn't show the whole picture. To put it simply: we're fucked. Instead of joining their liberators, the whole of Venezuela seems to have united against us, calling us foreign invaders (which we might very well be). We are at a desperate numerical, tactical and supply disadvantage. Fuck. \nThere might be a solution to a problem called Juán Guaido. Yeah, if we can get the presidential claimant to join us it's gg, as we would gain massive legitimacy, international backing and internal support among the Venezuelan people. \nHOWEVER, it's unlikely that once he becomes president of the country he'll let us keep those sweet, sweet oil reserves all to ourselves. Without him, Venezuela could be our Vegas. With him, we'll have to respect dumb stuff like human rights and the rule of law."

This state of affairs was short-lived, however, as Carmona's authoritarian posture and reversal of many of Chávez's key reforms angered much of the public and key sectors of the military. \nSoon, Carmona resigned his post and loyalist members Presidential Guard retook the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, restoring the old president and reverting the coup."

Carmona then passed the "Act Constituting the Government of Democratic Transition and National Unity", dissolving the National Assembly and the Supreme Court and declaring void the 1999 Constitution. While this decree proved unpopular, the announcement of elections to be held later this year calmed and appeased many of the pro-coup factions, and it seems that there's not much that the pro-Chávez forces can do now."
