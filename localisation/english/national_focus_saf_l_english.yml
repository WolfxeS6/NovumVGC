    SAF_race_laws_desc:0 "To preserve the purity and strength of our nation, we must implement strict race laws that separate and control the different ethnic groups within our borders. By institutionalizing racial segregation, we will ensure that the nation remains strong and united in the face of outside threats, while safeguarding our people from what we deem to be the corrosive effects of foreign influence and miscegenation."

    SAF_white_migrants_only_desc:0 "To preserve the strength and purity of our nation, we will open our doors only to those of European descent. By encouraging the settlement of white migrants, we will bolster our ranks with loyal, like-minded citizens who share our values and vision for a racially homogenous and prosperous future. This policy will safeguard our people and ensure the continuation of our dominant culture, while excluding foreign influences that threaten our way of life."

    SAF_resettle_cape_town_desc:0 "Cape Town, the jewel of our nation, has become a hotbed of foreign influence and racial mixing. To preserve the integrity of our people, we will begin the resettlement process, removing non-white populations from the city and replacing them with loyal, like-minded citizens. This will not only purify the city but will serve as a model for the rest of the nation, ensuring the strength of our people in the heart of our lands."

    SAF_establish_the_bantustans_desc:0 "Our vision of a racially pure state demands the creation of separate homelands for non-white populations. We will attack Swaziland and Lesotho, integrating them into the greater vision of ethnically distinct territories. By forcibly relocating those we deem 'undesirable,' we will ensure our nation's racial and cultural purity, as well as create a stronger political unity within the Afrikaner heartland."

    SAF_domination_once_more_desc:0 "It is time to reclaim the full strength and purity of our nation under the banner of one race, one destiny. Through the establishment of a total apartheid system, we will purge our land of foreign influence and racially impure elements, placing full power in the hands of our people. By consolidating our authority and enforcing strict separation, we will create a singular, unchallenged rule, ensuring the survival and dominance of our nation for generations to come."

By embracing Afrikaner Calvinism, we reinforce our commitment to racial purity, self-determination, and the divine right of the Afrikaner nation to rule. With this divine providence guiding us, our people will rise to their rightful place in the world, and we will maintain the strength of our nation through faith, discipline, and unity."

    SAF_voluntary_deportation_program_desc:0 "In order to ensure the long-term purity and strength of our nation, we will offer a 'voluntary' relocation program for those who do not belong to the dominant racial group. While the program will be presented as voluntary, those who refuse to comply will face increasing pressure and societal exclusion. In time, we will rid our land of unwanted elements and preserve our country for future generations, free from foreign influence and racial impurity."

    SAF_empower_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The paramilitary groups are the true backbone of our movement, and they must be given the strength and resources needed to maintain order and protect the purity of our nation. By empowering these forces, we ensure that our ideologies are carried out with force and efficiency, eliminating any opposition that threatens our cause. These groups will be granted increased authority, weapons, and support to protect our nation from internal and external enemies."

    SAF_reclaim_the_union_desc:0 "Our nation was once united, and it is time to restore what was lost. By reclaiming South West Africa, we will reassert our rightful authority over the region. Namibia must once again become a part of the Union, as we restore our nation's strength and honor. With military force or political pressure, we will bring the Namibian people back under our control, and secure our territorial integrity once more."

With the strength of our faith, our volk, and our fatherland, we shall stand resolute against all enemies. We are bound by a sacred covenant, where the Afrikaner people are entrusted with the governance of this land, a task ordained by God Himself. United under these guiding principles, we will restore the greatness of our nation and bring our people to their rightful place in the world."
