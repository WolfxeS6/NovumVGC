 usa.1.d:0 "On September 11th, 2001, four planes were abducted by terrorists of the Al-Qaeda network. The hijackers used the commercial airliners American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 as flying bombs against the United States. \n\nOn September 11th, 2001, at 8:46 AM, Flight 11 hits the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, shortly followed by Flight 175 hitting the South Tower at 9:03 AM. At 9:37 AM, Flight 77 hits the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and at 10:03 AM, Flight 93 crashes after the passengers attempted to take back the plane from the terrorists, causing the plane to not reach its intended target, which likely also was in Washington D.C..\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."

These reports were also confirmed even by five on-duty police officers across the region.\n\nThe aircraft, which made no sound and was reportedly massive in size, operated at treetop level altitude and was spotted several times between 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning.\n\nThe incident has once more funneled conspiracy theories about secret U.S. Air Force projects or, depending on the conspiracy theorist, an alien invasion or alien control of several world leaders, including the U.S. President [USA.GetLeader]."

 usa.4.d:0 "The massive American computer technology giant Microsoft has steadily expanded ever since its founding in 1975. Microsoft, especially dominant in the home computer markets with its Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98 operating systems, is always looking to broaden its outreach and the amount of computer programs it controls, arguably so that they can no longer be released on non-Microsoft operating systems.\n\nOne such target for expansion is the Seattle-based Visio Corporation, whose acquisition by Microsoft was initially announced in September of 1999. Visio, which is to become the Visio Division within the Microsoft Business Productivity Group, has especially met appraisal for its programs to generate charts, graphs and other data visualisation for corporate administrators, economic experts and product designers. Microsoft, which is paying 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars for the acquisition which is to be finalized on January 7th, 2000, hopes to strenghten its standing with professionals through the annexiation of Visio."

 usa.7.d:0 "Today, the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, will have to come to a decision in regards to the fate of young Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez is currently residing in Florida with relatives, after he survived the dangerous escape from Cuba to the United States - an escape during which his mother tragically died. However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardize the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."

 usa.10.d:0 "The death of comic legend Charles M. Schulz on February 12th, 2000, marked the end of a legend and the end of an era. The Minneapolis-born comic artist had drawn the "Peanuts" comic sketches for over 50 years, as well as most of the movie and television scripts of his comic children around Charlie Brown. In total more than 17,800 unique comics, "The Peanuts" was the longest-running comic series of all time. One day after the death of its creator, the last original Peanuts comic was published in the sunday newspapers.\n\nThe death of Schulz leaves comic fans and avid newspaper readers alike in mourning the country over. The comic series will not be continued in accordance with Schulz's wishes - but at 17,800 comics, there is pretty of rerunning that newspapers will be able to do."

The older gentleman of Jewish-Polish decent and long time independent member of the Senate (even though backed by the Democratic Party) is outspoken against American Imperialism and about the dominance of the wealthy over the unfortunate.\n\nIn times like these, populists seem viable. While populists like Donald Trump dominate right-wing rhetoric, the left-wing populism is not a great issue in the United States. Will Sanders change that?"

But that is exactly what happened: With several severe and sweeping changes to the rights of states, all American states have been turned into monarchies under authoritarian dukes - and these United Duchies also managed to abolish the Supreme Court, the House of Representatives and the Office of President, uniting all powers in the Senate - which is now controlled by not two senators per state, but by one 'Imperial Legate', handpicked by the respective duke. The United Duchies operate under the concept of 'The Vote of 30', where at least 30 legates have to agree to exercise the otherwise unchecked power of this new self-proclaimed 'Grand Council'."

Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.".\n\nThe Democrats up and down the country have begun rallying around Clinton's statements, signalling not only solidarity with their senator but also with the Republican administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

Karzai, initially a supporter of the Taliban government, started opposing their increasingly fascistic authoritarianism from 1996 onwards and fled to a United Nations embassy. In Pakistani Quetta, he founded an Anti-Taliban force together with his father and brother in 1997. He funded and armed Northern Alliance forces and sent financial support to Taliban victims and resistance forces within Afghanistan, all the while getting in contact with CIA operatives.\n\nIn 1999, Karzai's father, the Khan of the Pashtun Popalzai people, was assassinated by the Taliban in an attack which Karzai himself, now Khan, barely survived.

Utah would later take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in the case "Utah v. Evans", but ended up losing the case.\nThe population continues to age, with age brackets like 45 to 54 growing by 49% and the age bracket of 85 and older growing by 38%.\nWhen it comes to gender, women still outnumber men, especially because they outnumber men two to one in the 85 years and older bracket.\nSexual orientation, in compliance with policies like 'Don't ask, don't tell', was not documented - much to the dismay of gays and lesbians throughout the country."

However, a dominant victory in New Hampshire also gave McCain some prominence.\n\nMcCain ended up unable to use the momentum, winning only 7 contests (his home state Arizona as well as Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts). Keyes did even worse, not winning a single contest. The 43 other states as well as D.C. voted for George Bush, helped by McCain's withdrawal on March 9th.\n\nThe Republicans face a bit of ridicule because of the Bushs becoming a 'Presidential Dynasty' akin to the Democratic Kennedys, but George W.

 election_USA.1.d:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2000 was one of the most controversial elections in the history of the United States of America. After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"

In his place, the democratic party nominated one of its most established political veterans, John Kerry from Massachusetts. \n\nAgainst him, as expected, stands the ruling president, George W. Bush. The focus of the campaign is on terrorism inside and outside the United States, about the conflict in the Middle East, about shady dealings of the administration of Bush and Cheney and about the environment, which Bush was far less fond of protecting than Kerry."
 election_USA.2.d2:0 "After the victory of 2004, Al Gore set to implement environmental and social reforms that were opposed as violating the national spirit and strength by the Republican opposition. \n\nAfter George W. Bush had lost in 2000, he pulled out of politics and rejoined the oil industry in Texas. In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."

The Republican contests were also fierce, with the hardline faction finally losing out to the moderate fiscal conservatives around Vietnam veteran John McCain. \n\nOn election night, it seems like the Democrats, whose election slogan 'Yes, we can!' is heard across the country, might have the edge by as many as ten million votes.

The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"
 election_USA.5.d2:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has become a battle of two wings of populism.\n\nAfter the Democratic Nomination had been a close race that once more ended up seeing Hillary Clinton as the loser, as before in 2008; the Republican race quickly had become dominated by a far-right rhetoric battle between Donald Trump and similar-minded contestants like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nNow, both candidates promise to battle Wall Street influences and to give back America to the people. Who will it be? The independent senator, legend among left-wing progressives, from small Vermont, Bernie Sanders; or the successful and famous businessman from New York City, Donald Trump?"
 election_USA.5.d3:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been described as the 'battle of the sleeper agents' by a far-left online commentator. Both Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, the two major candidates, are hugely unpopular and are booed by wings of their own party for their uncharismatic behavior. Both the \"Sanders Progressives\" and the \"Trump Nationalists\" hate their party's candidate and are looking into alternatives, like the Greens, the Libertarians and the Constitutionalists. Who will it be among the 'sleeper agents' then? Cruz or Clinton?"
 election_USA.5.d4:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a lopsided affair, comparable to the Reagan, Nixon and Roosevelt landslides. Where the Democrats managed to bring a hugely popular progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders, into the mix; the Republicans failed to nominate a unifying candidate and went with Ted Cruz - a man that was described with flattering words like 'vindictive', 'straight-up evil' or 'the anti christ' even among fellow conservatives for his behavior of flip-flopping.\n\nThe polls are clear, Sanders is favored by a near 10% edge - but the electoral college is known to be a mischievous mistress. Can Cruz win?"
 election_USA.5.d5:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been titled 'battle of sociopaths' by left-wing TV host Bill Maher. Indeed it seems that both Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are unpopular, uncharismatic and pragmatic - but no one doubts that both of them have a certain talent as politicians.\n\nSo, which uninspiring, uncharismatic sociopath will it be? Marco Rubio from Florida or Hillary Clinton from New York?"
 election_USA.5.d6:0 "'I have never witnessed such a weak political performance, and that is saying something', neo-nazi leader Richard Spencer wrote about the first debate of the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIndeed, there is not much to be had for far-right voters when looking at the battle of two moderates, comparable to the 1992 election between Clinton and Bush Sr.\n\nThis time, Democratic candidate for nomination Clinton - but the female one - failed to overcome a far-left challenger in the form of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders and Rubio, apart from the far right criticism, have both been praised by the media for their respective campaigns that very much focussed on issues rather than mudslinging. 'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
 election_USA.5.d7:0 "'Kasich versus Clinton. If that sounds boring, wait until you see it.', TV show host Bill Maher snarked at the candidates the two major political parties chose.\n\nThe US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a shock to both far left and far right voters. Both campaigns have super moderate candidates, both campaigns have largely abstained from mudslinging moves, both campaigns have been described as being lead by 'corrupt kleptocrats' by an MSNBC commentator.\n\nThat sounds demotivating, but one these needs to be president. So let's go for it! Who will it be? Clinton or Kasich?"
 election_USA.5.d8:0 "'This had to have been the most left-wing campaigns I ever saw in my life, it's horrible', Ann Coulter complained on Fox News about the second Presidential Debate of the 2016 US Election.\n\nA far left Democrat, Bernie Sanders, meets a very moderate fiscal Republican, John Kasich, in the arena of the longest and most expensive election of not only American but also world history.\n\nSanders slashed Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for his stance on Planned Parenthood and his cowardly mannerisms when dealing with big business, while Kasich called Vermont senator Sanders out for the very extended gun rights in his home state, thus making Sanders' gun control platform one of hipocrisy.\n\n'This campaign has been highly productive and interesting', a British foreign policy observer commented on the BBC.

By 2010, opinion polls routinely suggested that Labor would not be able to win the next election if it continued on this path. According to ABC's 7:30 Report', the seeds for Gillard to challenge candidate Rudd were sown by "Victorian Right factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten MP and Senator David Feeney, who had between them secured the support of "New South Wales power broker" Mark Arbib. Feeney and Arbib discussed the matter of a potential leadership challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and began a numbers count to establish the feasibility of a leadership challenge. The pair found that there was more than enough support for Gillard for the challenge to proceed. The declining ratings for both the Labor Party and Rudd personally were attributed to many factors, including problems with the Home Insulation Program, a significant delay to a planned carbon emissions reduction scheme, a move to introduce mandatory internet filtering, the proposed introduction of the Resource Super Profits Tax, and the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. Senior Labor MPs conceded that the ALP's primary vote had dropped below 30% in some key marginal seats, a figure which if replicated at a federal election would have seen a Labor defeat."

A number of senior ministers spoke to the press later that evening attacking Shorten, while Bruce Hawker and Senator Doug Cameron gave interviews supporting Shorten. Shorten himself held a second press conference the following morning, outlining his policy vision for Australia and saying that he wished to 'save' Australia from a Liberal-led government. Shorten stated, 'I do not believe that our Leader Rudd can lead the Australian Labor Party to success in the next election.'"

 australia.10.d:0 "After the Western Australian state election on 9 March, two federal ministers from the state conceded that the Gillard leadership's troubles had impacted on the poor result. Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at doorstops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down. Later in March, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals—called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher—Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns". On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from Cabinet and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm AEDST that afternoon. Just 10 minutes prior to the scheduled ballot, Rudd announced that he would not stand in the ballot."

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

Earlier in the year the ALP caucus approved changes to the way the federal parliamentary leader is chosen. The new rules make it more difficult to change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. The new rules encourage the parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership. The new rules are controversial, however, and have been publicly criticised by ALP Senator Stephen Conroy and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Nominations opened at a parliamentary party meeting on Friday 13 September 2013, and remained open for a week. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten formally nominated. As there was more than one nomination, a ballot of the parliamentary party and another of the organisational party were required. The ballot of the organisational party lasted for two weeks."

In this speech, as a follow-up to the poorly-received 2014 budget, Abbott made a new commitment to further cut tax rates for small businesses, promised that the 2015 budget would leave families better off and agreed to reduce the role his chief of staff Peta Credlin played in the government. After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us'. Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the 'narrow margin' of the vote left the party Leader 'deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation'. News Limited journalist Malcolm Farr wrote that the leader had been 'given, at best, a stay of execution'. In May, information was leaked about citizenship changes.

In a speech at a local school, Abbott expressed his disappointment in Turnbull's leadership and policies, signalling a clear divide once again between the two long-time political enemies. On the other side of the country, Julie Bishop met with members of the West Australian Liberal Party to discuss her plan of action in the looming leadership spill.

The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands.

The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparantly belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages.

However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."

 mauritania.2.t:0 "New Flag Proposal"
 mauritania.2.d:0 "Our ruling party has proposed to amend the national flag by the addition of a thin red stripe at the top and bottom. These stripes symbolise the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory. The proposal was part of a more general project of institutional reform presented during the Conference on Inclusive Dialogue. [Root.GetLeader]'s proposed reform also included the adoption of a new national anthem and the proclamation of a 'Second Republic'."

 mauritania.3.d:0 "The National Inclusive Dialogue has ended with an agreement by the government and moderate opposition to call for a referendum, something that has been sought since 2010. Back then the proposal didn't necessarily include a flag change for Mauritania, but was instead purely based around removing the Senate, two limit term and 75 age limit for the presidency. Currently the referendum to pass proposals put forward at the Conference is slated for late 2016, but if the National Assembly has trouble going forward, it could be pushed into 2017."

The decision was revealed just yesterday during a joint press conference. Now scheduled for early 2017, the national vote seeks approval of several decisions taken during the political dialogue, itself boycotted by the overwhelming majority of opposition parties. Mauritanians are called upon, among others, to advise on the abolition of the Senate and certain institutions, the creation of regional councils and changes to national symbols."
 mauritania.4.o1:0 "Disgraceful."
 mauritania.5.t:0 "Referendum Cancelled"
 mauritania.5.d:0 "Announced with great pomp by President [Root.GetLeader] himself, the popular referendum to approve constitutional changes contained in the resolutions of the national inclusive dialogue from October will ultimately not take place. These changes included radical moves to abolish the senate, create decentralised regional councils and modify the flag and national anthem. This change of high importance, revealed at the end of a meeting between the President and senators still arouses a stir. Thus, in place of popular consultation, the Mauritanian authorities decided to limit themselves to the vote of the Parliament sitting in congress to validate the reforms. This decision is motivated mostly by a supposedly 'difficult economic situation', a truth that the President himself now seems to recognise."
 mauritania.5.o1:0 "To Parliament it is then."

 mauritania.6.d:0 "The debate on constitutional changes has begun in our lower house, the National Assembly.

 mauritania.8.d:0 "The National Assembly in its plenary session yesterday, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Mohamedould Boilil, adopted by secret vote Constitutional Bill 118/17, revising the 1991 constitution of Mauritania and its amending texts. During the debate, members of our lower house discussed the legality of the proposed revision, the national flag 'improvements', the abolition of the Senate and various other amendments that President [Root.GetLeader] and his ruling party hope to enact sooner rather than later. For our head of state, this is certainly a great victory. However, the bill must still pass through the Senate or else it will surely go to a national referendum as initially suggested."

 mauritania.9.d:0 "Mauritania's senate rejected a contentious constitutional amendment on its own abolition and the alteration of the national flag to better represent those who battled for independence from France. 33 Senators out of 56 voted against the package, the President of the Senate stated not long ago. The rejection comes after lawmakers in our lower house passed the proposed measures more than a week ago, with full support from the ruling party. The amendment is therefore definitively defeated by the upper house, and hence it is up to the President to decide whether to continue by way of a referendum."

'Due to this rejection, we have arrived at an impasse. But there is one way out: we will hold a referendum', said President [Root.GetLeader] at a press conference. The government has a majority in both chambers, but 24 ruling party senators voted against the measure, highlighting what the President said was a 'dysfunction in our democracy'."
 mauritania.10.o1:0 "To the polls it is!"
 mauritania.11.t:0 "Referendum Campaign Begins"
 mauritania.11.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader] launched a campaign on Friday for a constitutional referendum boycotted by opposition figures who call the vote a smokescreen to keep the ruling party in power. The boycott movement draws broad political support from Islamists and anti-slavery activists, all of whom oppose measures including abolishing the Senate and changing the national flag. More than 1.4 million Mauritanians are eligible to vote on the constitutional changes, set to be voted on in the very near future."
 mauritania.11.o1:0 "Ok."
 mauritania.12.t:0 "Referendum Succeeds"
 mauritania.12.d:0 "On a turnout of 53.73 percent of the 1.4 million Mauritanians eligible to vote, 85 percent yesterday voted 'yes' to abolition of the Senate and changes to the country's flag, the national electoral commission said today. President Aziz said the changes would bring our nation 'peace, security, stability and development' and said the boycott movement existed 'only on paper and social media'. The opposition has stated it would not recognise the results of this referendum, denouncing it in a statement today as an electoral farce, also adding that people had 'clearly rejected the constitutional amendments'. Nevertheless, the ruling party's goal has finally been achieved and Mauritania can be placed back on the path of progress towards a stronger future amongst countless threats."

Many other European nations do not give such a position to a particular church body. This, in the eyes of critics, does not only discriminate against foreigners of non-Christian belief, but also the small catholic and orthodox communities of Sweden.\n\nThere is no real power held by the Church of Sweden anymore.

Handing the crown back to the English is not an option, so there are essentially three choices: Give the crown to a traditional candidate, to a cultural candidate, or give it to an accomplished candidate.\nOf course, the descendants of George Washington first come to mind when talking about a king. Paul Emory Washington of San Antonio is the first president's closest living descendant and would make a fine figurehead for a royal order of power. But you could also go for a candidate of America's culture, the culture of capitalism.

After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again.

Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency.

Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous.

 usa_news.19.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] delivered a live address shortly after explosions rocked the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, signalling the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The U.S.-led campaign aims at ridding Iraq of its dictator, Saddam Hussein, and eliminating its ability to store, develop, and deploy its stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. The strike comes just days after Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein defied a 48-hour deadline to leave the country. In response to the millitary invasion, the Republic of Iraq Radio in Baghdad said that "The evil ones, the enemies of God, the homeland and humanity, have committed the stupid aggression against our homeland and people.". Meanwhile, US military sources have said that five key members of the Iraqi regime, including Saddam Hussein, were targeted in the first attacks."

 usa_news.20.d:0 "U.S. tanks drove unhindered into public squares as downtown Baghdad slipped from the grip of the Ba'ath regime. The scene in central Baghdad, where Iraqi citizens and American marines collaberated in toppling a huge statue of Saddam Hussein, signaled that a complete American military victory in Iraq may be achieved within a matter of days, not months, although there may still be some difficult combat ahead in outlying Baghdad neighborhoods and areas north of the capital, including Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. No one knows whether Hussein and his two sons are alive or dead, but the fall of Baghdad suggests that organized resistance to the invading forces could subside now that the centralized institutions of power in Iraq have been shattered."

 usa_news.23.d:0 "The last convoy of U.S. soldiers pulled out of Iraq, ending nearly nine years of war that inflicted many casualties on both sides, and left a country grappling with political uncertainty. The final column of around 100 mostly U.S. military MRAP armoured vehicles carrying 500 U.S. troops trundled across the southern Iraq desert from their last base through the night and daybreak along an empty highway to the Kuwaiti border. For the United States, the military pullout is the fulfilment of a promise to bring troops home from a conflict, widely considered the most unpopular war since Vietnam and one that tainted America’s standing worldwide. For Iraqis, though, the departure brings a sense of sovereignty tempered by nagging fears their country may slide once again into the kind of sectarian violence that killed many thousands of people at its peak in 2006-2007."
