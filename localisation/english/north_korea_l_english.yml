DPR Korea's right to command army is the Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong-il had it.\n\nMany experts believe that the Kim Yong-nam government is simply a puppet and only follows orders directed by Kim Jong-il. However, if there is a crisis in Kim Jong-il's political influence, he will exercise his power as president."
 
 POLITICS_KIM_JONG_IL_DESC:0 "Kim Jong-il is DPR Korea's dictator and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. He officially became DPR Korea's head of state in 2009, but in reality, his father, Kim Il-sung, had already taken hold of DPR Korea's political power since the 1980s when he was getting old.\n\nKim Jong-il succeeded his father, Kim Il-sung, and made DPR Korea a very strict religious dictatorship that worships him.

During Kim Jong-il's reign, DPR Korea developed its own nuclear program and was isolated from the international community."

Takada became the wife of Kim Jong-il and had children of Kim Jong-un and Kim Yo-jong.\n\nAs the assassination of Kim Jong-il by democratic revolutionaries and the civil war situation in DPR Korea began, she led the DPR Korean government without any preparation. With many citizens already supporting the new democratic government, Takada is likely to be the last leader of the Juche dictatorship."

However, the coup d'etat in Japan and the resulting collapse of Japanese democracy halted his animation director activities. At this time, the democratic revolution in North Korea, liberal movement, and the new government's support for animation made him choose asylum.\n\nBut the emergence of a new dictator has made him an unexpected political leader. Having produced animations with messages against fascism and dictatorship, he became a symbol of liberals. After the end of the second democratic revolution in North Korea, Miyazaki became president with overwhelming support from liberals."

In the early days of the WPK's founding, the WPK was a firm Marxist-Leninist communist party. However, the political ideology of the WPK began to be confused after August Faction Incident. In August 1956, Kim Il-sung conducted a massive purge of Pro-China and Pro-Soviet Union politicians in DPR Korea and turned the WPK into a party loyal to Kim Il-sung individuals. After the decline of Marxism-Leninism, Juche, a ultranationalism ideology that emphasizes the excellence of DPR Koreans and the worship of Kim il-sung individuals, emerged as a new ideology in the WPK.§!"

 adviser_PRK_kim_jong_il_desc:0 "The 'Great Leader(Suryŏng)' of DPR Koreans, Kim Jong-il was born in Camp Voroshilov, Primorsky Krai, Soviet Union in 1941 under the name Yuri Irsenovich Kim. He continued to use the Soviet name Yuri Irsenovich Kim until 1960, but changed his name to Kim Jong-il when he decided to live in DPR Korea. He became a member of the WPK in 1961 and, along with his father, Kim Il-sung, began working as a DPR Korean politician.\n\nHe began to influence DPR Korean politics in earnest, leading the Three Great Revolutions in 1973. Kim Jong-il argued that revolution was needed in three areas: thought, technology, and culture, allowing the WPK to take more direct control of agriculture, industry, and administrative agencies. The revolution of the 1970s made the DPR Korean regime more autocratic and oppressive, while at the same time making Kim Jong-il more influential in DPR Korean politics. When Kim il-sung died in 1994, he became the de facto ruler of DPR Korea. DPR Korea's legal leader was President Kim Yong-nam, but Kim Yong-nam had no influence over the military.\n\nKim Jong-il's succession to power was tolerated by civilians who worshiped the Kim dynasty as a 'living god', but it was perceived by intellectuals and politicians as abnormal. Then, in the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the disappearance of financial aid from communist countries, which led to famine in DPR Korea. This has sparked opposition to Kim Jong-il within DPR Korea. In 1997, Kim Jong-il began a purge of intellectuals and politicians who opposed him, and massacres called Simhwajo Purge were widespread throughout DPR Korea.\n\nThere is no longer any public opposition to Kim Jong-il's dictatorship under the influence of the Simhwajo Purge. However, the continued slaughter is also increasing the number of generals in the military who are skeptical of Kim Jong-il. Whether Kim Jong-il's dictatorship can continue, or there will be a revolution to end his dictatorship. It is not yet known."

Trained special forces will call themselves Pro Kim Jong-il rebels and stage a coup against [PRK.GetLeader] in Pyongyang. Of course, this coup is a fake, and it will fail according to the operation. After the fake coup, the 'rebel' leaves North Korea and attempts to 'exile' to Japan. This 'exile' is carried out by infiltrating Japanese territory with weapons, occupying the city and attacking residents.\n\nIf this operation succeeds, the Japanese will suffer great economic damage.

He continued to use the Soviet name Yuri Irsenovich Kim until 1960, but changed his name to Kim Jong-il when he decided to live in DPR Korea. He became a member of the WPK in 1961 and, along with his father, Kim Il-sung, began working as a DPR Korean politician.\n\nHe began to influence DPR Korean politics in earnest, leading the Three Great Revolutions in 1973. Kim Jong-il argued that revolution was needed in three areas: thought, technology, and culture, allowing the WPK to take more direct control of agriculture, industry, and administrative agencies. The revolution of the 1970s made the DPR Korean regime more autocratic and oppressive, while at the same time making Kim Jong-il more influential in DPR Korean politics. When Kim il-sung died in 1994, he became the de facto ruler of DPR Korea. DPR Korea's legal leader was President Kim Yong-nam, but Kim Yong-nam had no influence over the military.\n\nKim Jong-il's succession to power was tolerated by civilians who worshiped the Kim dynasty as a 'living god', but it was perceived by intellectuals and politicians as abnormal. Then, in the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the disappearance of financial aid from communist countries, which led to famine in DPR Korea. This has sparked opposition to Kim Jong-il within DPR Korea. In 1997, Kim Jong-il began a purge of intellectuals and politicians who opposed him, and massacres called Simhwajo Purge were widespread throughout DPR Korea.\n\nThere is no longer any public opposition to Kim Jong-il's dictatorship under the influence of the Simhwajo Purge. However, the continued slaughter is also increasing the number of generals in the military who are skeptical of Kim Jong-il. Whether Kim Jong-il's dictatorship can continue, or there will be a revolution to end his dictatorship. It is not yet known."
