 big_tent:0 "Big Tent"
 big_tent_desc:1 "Big Tent doesn't mean political ideology. This happens when a number of political forces with different ideologies are united under one party or political force. Because Big Tent is made up of a coalition of forces with different political ideologies, it has the advantage of being able to win support from various voters.

 authoritarian_socialist:0 "Authoritarian Socialism"
 authoritarian_socialist_desc:0 "After the fall of the Soviet Union and the communist bloc in the late 80s and early 90s, Marxism-Leninism and communism in general lost much of their position as a dominant global ideological force.
