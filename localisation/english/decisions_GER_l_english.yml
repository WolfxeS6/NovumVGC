Hartz_I:0 "Hartz I"
Hartz_I_desc:0 "The first stage of the Hartz reforms introduces new employment policies, making the labor market more flexible. While businesses benefit from easier hiring processes, workers face an increase in temporary contracts and job insecurity."
Hartz_II:0 "Hartz II"
Hartz_II_desc:0 "Hartz II promotes 'mini-jobs' and self-employment, allowing low-income workers to take up small, tax-friendly employment. While this helps combat unemployment, it also leads to the rise of a precarious low-wage sector."
Hartz_III:0 "Hartz III"
Hartz_III_desc:0 "Hartz III restructures the Federal Employment Agency, making job placement and training programs more efficient. While it improves workforce mobility, public trust in the agency declines due to increased pressure on the unemployed."
Hartz_IV:0 "Hartz IV"
Hartz_IV_desc:0 "The most controversial phase of the reform, Hartz IV significantly reduces long-term unemployment benefits, forcing many to re-enter the workforce. Though it lowers welfare dependency, it also sparks public unrest and debates over social inequality"
