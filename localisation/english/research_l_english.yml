The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a parabolic antenna is that it has high directivity.

 basic_encryption:1 "Encryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_encryption_desc:0 "Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security."
 improved_encryption:1 "Encryption - Hash Functions"
 improved_encryption_desc:0 "A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file."
 advanced_encryption:1 "Encryption - Modern Implementation of AES"
 advanced_encryption_desc:0 "The Advanced Encryption Standard, also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution–permutation network and is efficient in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits."
 near_future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Device-Independent Quantum Cryptography"
 near_future_encryption_desc:0 "A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful. Thus, the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices. Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols."
 future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Post-Quantum Cryptography"
 future_encryption_desc:0 "Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm."
 basic_decryption:1 "Decryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_decryption_desc:0 "A potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments, in all instances, so as to avoid suspicion."
 improved_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hash Attacks"
 improved_decryption_desc:0 "There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions, but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable against length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable against this specific attack."
 advanced_decryption:1 "Decryption - AES Side-Channel Attacks"
 advanced_decryption_desc:0 "Side-channel attacks do not attack the cipher as a black box, and thus are not related to cipher security as defined in the classical context but are important in practice. They attack implementations of the cipher on hardware or software systems that inadvertently leak data. Due to the accepted reality that AES is unbreakable, this is the primary mode of attack against it."
 near_future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hypothetical Quantum Security Attacks"
 near_future_decryption_desc:0 "A rise in quantum encryption calls for advances in respective decryption. By modifying age-old methods, and developing uniquely quantum attacks, the balance of security will remain uncertain."
 future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Post-Quantum Security Research"
 future_decryption_desc:0 "In cryptography research, it is desirable to prove the equivalence of a cryptographic algorithm and a known hard mathematical problem. These proofs are often called "security reductions” and are used to demonstrate the difficulty of cracking the encryption algorithm. In other words, the security of a given cryptographic algorithm is reduced to the security of a known hard problem. Researchers are actively looking for security reductions in the prospects for post quantum cryptography."

 artillery2:0 "Improved DPICM"
 artillery2_desc:0 "A Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition is a warhead designed to burst into sub-munitions at an optimum altitude and distance from the desired target for dense area coverage. The sub-munitions use both explosively formed penetrators for anti-armor work and fragmentation for antipersonnel work."

 antiair7_desc:0 "By utilising a swift reload system or higher-capacity missile housing, more missiles may be fired within shorter periods of time."
 antitank1:0 "Tandem-Charge Warheads"
 antitank1_desc:0 "Tandem charges are effective against reactive armour, which is designed to protect an armoured vehicle against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the reactive armour of the target without detonating it, leaving a channel through the reactive armour so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonating the armour plate causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail."
 antitank3:0 "Varied Ammo Types"

 battlefield_support:0 "Battlefield Support"
 battlefield_support_desc:0 "It is difficult for Tactical bombers to attack targets near where our ground forces are in combat, since level bombing is less accurate than dive bombing, but more training and interaction with ground-based observers can help to overcome these problems."
 carousel_bombing:0 "Carousel Bombing"
 carousel_bombing_desc:0 "Bombers often simply want to dump all their bombs as soon they reach their target area and then fly home as soon as possible. While this can work for area-bombing, when it comes to hitting a small target it is more effective to linger over the target, dropping only a portion of their bomb load at a time for maximum accuracy."
