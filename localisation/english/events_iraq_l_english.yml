Third, to capture and drive terrorists out of the country as well as secure the Iraqi oilfields.

 IRQ_flavor.10.t:0 "The Generals Meet"
 IRQ_flavor.10.d:0 "Generals from Iraq have convened on the present war situation and have presented Saddam with two plans to keep fighting the war. Fighting defensively would eventually wear out American public support of the war, and cause them to surrender. However other opinions from the more bolder generals suggest launching a full offensive in order to win a decisive victory. As there is no clear consensus, Saddam ends the silence..."
 IRQ_flavor.10.o1:0 "with hesitance, saying ''The Yankees will fold under constant attrition.''"
 IRQ_flavor.10.o2:0 "boldly exclaiming ''Hah! We have American pigs on the ropes! Counterattack NOW!''"
