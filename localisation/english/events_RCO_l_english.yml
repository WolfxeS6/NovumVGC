 precw.1.d:0 "Zyuganov, recently elected president of the country, was removed from power yesterday evening. Unknown people in military uniform entered his Kremlin office and politely asked him to leave the office. After a short conversation, Zyuganov simply left, the soldiers did not even have to use force. A few hours later, the new government appeared on TV, announcing "the prevention of communist slavery and a return to the totalitarian past." Vladimir Putin became the head of the new government. Although support for the Communist Party invariably fell in society due to the half-way reformist course of the party, such an anti-constitutional coup caused a wave of protests. People spontaneously gather in the central squares of cities, speaking in support of Zyuganov. However, it seems that even he himself has no control over protests."

 pprecw.1.t:0 "Results of our policy"
 pprecw.1.d:0 "The indecision of the new government and Zyuganov personally in carrying out radical reforms and struggling with Yeltsin`s oligarchy led to the loss of popular confidence and support for the new president`s policy. At the same time, the pro-Yeltsin elements are still strongly opposing the CPRF, no matter what course it will take. The sabotage of the capitalists and the sanctions of the West are hitting the Russian economy very hard, while the starting economic crisis hits most of the Russian people. This of course leads to additional loss of popular support for the CPRF and the president himself."

 precw.2.t:0 "Results of the coup"
 precw.2.d:0 "The protests were unorganised, so they had no effect and were quickly suppressed by the new government. The government announced its provisional character. This time, it is proposed that the fate of Russia will be decided not by the constituent assembly, but by the parliament, in which early elections will be held soon. Situations with economic instability and crisis are getting only worse: foreign investments are leaving Russia, and even Russian oligarchs see no perspective in developing their Russian enterprises and putting money out of the country. In these conditions, the government raises tariffs and taxes on the population. Seems, the entire crisis will be held by the Russian people."

 precw.3.d:0 "The economic situation in Russia is getting worse, as are the living conditions of the majority of the population. This leads to a wave of crime and spontaneous unorganised protests against the government. Capital is still leaving Russia."
 precw.3.a:0 "Situation is getting worse"
 precw.4.t:0 "United Communist Front"
 precw.4.d:0 "As instability in Russia grows, different communist and some radical left parties in Russia decided to unite in one coalition to organise and lead people's anger against the government. Coalition consists of: RKRP, national bolsheviks, different small left groups and even CPRF takes part in this coalition. On the other hand, reactionary pro-government and far-right elements are also starting to unite across the country as police seems to be able to disobey government in the very critical situation, which can happen in near future."
 precw.4.a:0 "Situation is getting worse"
precw.8.t:0 "Meanwhile at Factories"
 precw.8.d:0 "Though Russia lost a lot of industry in 1990`s, there are still about 10-15 millions of fabric workers in the country. Their living and working conditions are very bad in comparison with the ones they had in the USSR. With the new crisis they're getting even worse. While there were some events in the 90`s of workers takeover of factories and even workers' militia have sometimes been formed, but nowadays in Russia, with capitalists leaving the country and closing enterprises, acts of workers self-management and takeover of factories are happening across Russia. RKRP has never lost its contacts with workers even after 1992-1993 events, so now they are leading many workers actions and even forming Soviets in some small fabric sites. Government slowly losing power in Russia, while the Soviets are returning to the political stage."
 precw.8.a:0 "History repeats itself"
 precw.5.t:0 "Critical moment is getting closer"
 precw.5.d:0 "People's support for the new communist block rises. Now newly unemployed and wide masses of people with small income groups around the left coalition. However, this coalition seems to be not very united as CPRF talks against Soviets and radical politics of RKRP and nazbols. However, the radical part of the coalition holds a lot of worker congresses and conferences. The most powerful of them for now is the Russian workers committee. Delegates to this meeting are sent from workers collectives from all over Russia, delegates work out united tactics and share workers experience of anti-government actions. This committee is highly influenced by RKRP and now it calls for general strike and congress of Soviets."
 precw.5.a:0 "History repeats itself"
 precw.6.t:0 "First all-Russian Congress of Soviets"
 precw.6.d:0 "General strike has partially collapsed our country. Police cannot even fight criminal elements, right radicals are fighting with communist and workers groups across the country, and the government can hardly be around itself. In this situation communists decided to call for a Congress of Soviets in Petersburg, a heart of revolutionary movement in Russia. In this chaotic situation most delegates will surely arrive in Petersburg and hold the Congress. Perhaps, communists want to repeat bolshevik success and form a new government on the basis of Congress, which will be declared a Supreme power in Russia."
 precw.6.a:0 "Try to deal with it"
 precw.7.t:0 "[GetMonth] congress of UCF"
 precw.7.d:0 "[GetMonth] UCF congress was held, at which the current situation was considered and tasks were set for the near future. The congress was semi-legal. At this congress, M.V. Popov and other prominent figures of the RCWP issued a statement that the time had come to prepare for a socialist revolution. These speeches caused a lot of controversy at the congress. The CPRF split into two factions. The left faction supported the thesis of the RKRP, while the main part of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, together with Zyuganov, opposed it and, having not received the support of the majority of the congress, left it."

Police and army brigades refused to obey our orders, while squads of right radicals were crushed by armed workers militia, which had been guarding the Congress. Before the Congress began, RKRP together with national bolsheviks had formed the Revolutionary military committee. Communists used workers' militia to capture most important city infrastructure and government buildings. When Congress started, communists announced that from now on all power belongs to the Congress."

 rco_politprosvet.2.d:0 "This morning the constituent congress of the Comintern began. Communist parties of many countries of the world, but not all, were invited to the event. The congress discussed the tactics of the communist parties in the struggle for communism, the attitude of the International towards fascism and social democracy, as well as many other organisational issues. Particularly heated debates were held on the issue of attitudes towards Chinese communism."

 rco_politprosvet.3.t:0 "What is Soviet power?"
 rco_politprosvet.3.d:0 "Soviet power is a fundamentally different form of power than the parliamentary system. The new Soviet power in Russia is based on the workplace election principle. Elections take place not by territory, but by production units: plants and factories. The elections themselves and the acquaintance of the workers-voters with the candidates take place at special factory meetings. In the future, the deputy reports on his actions directly to the workers who elected him, at similar factory meetings. This provides the voters with real control over the actions of deputies and a real right of recall.\nLocal Soviets send deputies to form higher-level Soviets. The highest authority is the Congress of Soviets. It approves candidates for ministerial posts and creates a commission that controls the actions of the government.\nInitially, it was planned to create two chambers: the chamber of factory workers and the chamber of clergy. But the revolution made another decision. So far, only the Chamber of Workers is functioning. This creates a solid foundation for the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, a minority of the country's population is now represented in power, although it is the most organised and advanced one."

 rco_politprosvet.4.t:0 "Cancel of war communism"
 rco_politprosvet.4.d:0 "The war is over, and we can no longer continue the policy of war communism, that is, the policy of maximum centralization and concentration of resources for the needs of the war. There are several reasons for this.\nFirstly, war communism presupposes the maximum exertion of the forces of the people: working for food, giving up all luxury, and so on. People are no longer able to withstand such harsh living conditions.\nThe second reason is organisational. War communism stops the building of socialist social relations. Working for food means that workers have no incentive to develop production. The factory's management does not care about its profitability, because. their only task is to make a certain amount of products from the raw materials they receive.\nThus, the policy of war communism must be cancelled."

 rco_politprosvet.5.d:0 "Now we face the task of reestablishing a planned economy in Russia. It is important to avoid the mistakes that led to economic stagnation in the USSR. After analysing the experience of the Soviet era, the party decided to follow the path of the Stalinist Soviet economy. Moreover, one of its foundations, the principle of cost reduction, has already been incorporated into our economy.\nThe system of trusts and syndicates in industry will allow us to combine the initiative of the lower levels and the unity of the economic system in the required proportion. One of the principles of the new Soviet economic model is:0 "Centralization of planning functions, decentralisation of operational functions""

 rco_politprosvet.5.b:0 "Tell me more"
 rco_politprosvet.12.t:0 "How does system of trusts and syndicates work"
 rco_politprosvet.12.d:0 "Trusts and syndicates are formed by branches and territories. That means that all enterprises within the same industry are combined into a trust in a certain territory. Upon merging, enterprises lose their independence and from now on are subordinate to the management of the trust, which creates a single production plan for the entire trust and deploys it for each enterprise. However, each enterprise has its own operational fund, formed from a part of the enterprise's profit, which it uses for its own needs without attracting additional subsidies from the trust. The issues of supplying enterprises and marketing their products are also solved centrally at the level of the entire association. Thus, within the trust, the products of production do not move like goods, narrowing the scope of market laws and replacing them with systematic planning.\nSyndicates are engaged in the sale of enterprises' products in the same way according to the territorial and sectoral principle. The trust sells its products to a trading syndicate, who sells it through a system of state or cooperative stores. If we are talking about goods, which used for production of another products (machine tools, products of the mining industry), then the syndicate interacts with trusts, selling them such products and so supplying them.\nThe system of trusts and syndicates allows us to effectively combine the independence of lower parts of the economy and the unity of its leadership, while replacing the old market relations with new, communist ones."

This means that from now on, every enterprise should be profitable. This implies the introduction of cost accounting at all levels of production: from brigades to ministries. Of course, universal cost accounting is a matter for the future. But for the time being, we need to convert at least the individual enterprises themselves, as well as all the trusts and syndicates, to self-sufficiency. A system of trusts and syndicates in industry, implying fixed prices and making it possible to plan production, will be a reliable support for the principle of khozraschyot."

Working people, treating their work as "a matter of honour, valour and glory," work for the good of the Motherland, sparing no effort. So far, we are only at the first stage of shock work. Our industry has not yet been re-equipped with new machines, and our workers cannot show their full potential. Now shock work is carried out mainly by overexertion of forces: additional working hours or faster work. But it is an undeniable fact that when our workers take our new  up to-date equipment into their hands, which we will begin to produce in the near future, they will reveal its full potential and will give 200 and 300 percent of output, achieving this not by overstraining forces, but by improving working methods and achieving the highest mastery of new industrial machines."

A question about new party program was submitted to the party congress.\nThe main points of the new program:\n\n1.Soviet Russia is a socialist country that is at the stage of building the first phase of a communist society - socialism.\n\n2.RKRP is the vanguard of the Soviet proletariat. The RKWP is the ruling party in Soviet Russia. The RCWP leads the proletariat and as long as the proletariat itself elects the representatives of the RCWP to the Soviets.\n\n3.The RCWP sees the speedy achievement of the first phase of communism as the first task in the field of state building.\n\n4.The most important tasks on the path of building socialism are: destroying differences between town and country, the destruction of the exploiting classes, the introduction of a universal 6-hour working day, the reduction of inequality.\n\n5.In the sphere of education, it is necessary to make education completely free, and also make polytechnic education universal.\n\n6.In the field of international policy RCWP strives for mutually beneficial cooperation with all progressive forces and countries. At the same time,one of the most important tasks is the integration of the former Soviet republics and the restoration of the USSR within the borders of 1945."

 rco_politprosvet.9.t:0 "Economic program"
 rco_politprosvet.9.d:0 "The economic policy of the communists who came to power in Russia, on the one hand, is an attempt to recreate the Stalinist economic system using modern technologies,and on the other hand, it is a practical implementation of the theoretical researches of a number of late Soviet economists in the field of the so-called. "the law of use value".\nThe Stalinist system of trusts and syndicates in industry has been introduced in Soviet Russia. At the same time, the functions of general planning are assumed by the State Planning Commission.\nThe law of use value actually means that the main indicator by which the efficiency of an enterprise is determined is the indicator of reducing the cost of production, that is, in fact, the reduction in labour costs per unit of output. With the help of this measure, the government of Soviet Russia plans to develop a system of permanent price reduction based on lowering the cost of production, which should strengthen the Soviet currency and contribute to an increase in the living standards of Soviet citizens. At the same time, part of the "saved labour" will be used to reduce the length of the working day. First up to 6, and then up to 4-5 hours a day. This task is considered by the leadership of Soviet Russia to be one of the most important, since by this people will have more time for self-development, self-organisation and other useful activities."

Secondly, we have re-equipped our industry with the latest equipment, and now we have great perspectives in further increasing labour productivity with the enthusiasm of the working masses in mastering new industrial equipment.\nBut our people have gone even further. A movement for a communist attitude to labour was born in the advanced labour collectives. It implies not only labour enthusiasm, but also generally exemplary behaviour in everyday and personal life, worthy of a Soviet citizen.\nThe movement for a communist attitude to labour is, without a doubt, a new step that we have reached on the path to building a communist society, which is based on the principle of treating work as a duty."

This solution might look good for us, if the war against Chechens is going to too well. Moreover we can return to Chechenian question later, once we crush the Red Army. \nHowever, if we are already winning the struggle with Chechenian terrorists, or at least managed to somewhat contain them, then perhaps it might be better to just destroy them and prevernt any future problems, which will surely appear with radical Islimists in the south of Russia."

The Kremlin’s message offers no room for negotiation, warning that refusal will be seen as an act of rebellion against the Soviet resurgence.

Many democratic nations are urging a coordinated embargo to economically isolate the Soviet state and curb its ambitions. However, Moscow, aware of its precarious position, has extended an alternative proposition: a series of lucrative trade agreements and economic incentives for those who reject the embargo.

They frame this offer as an opportunity to restore the global balance of power and revive the vision of international socialism. Alongside their proposal, the Soviets promise a generous package of economic aid, including essential resources, technological support, and infrastructure investments, to strengthen our economy and national resilience. However, this offer comes with strings attached. Joining the New Comintern would align us directly with the Soviet Union’s ambitions, risking significant diplomatic fallout with other nations, particularly our southern neighbor and their allies. Conversely, rejecting the Soviet overtures could isolate us from a potential ally and leave us to face the harsh realities of our economic struggles alone.

The world is shifting, and aligning with the Soviets could provoke tensions with other powers.

The Soviet Union's message is firm, and the pressure is mounting.

Their diplomats have made it clear that they view this as an unresolved historical grievance, and their message is uncompromising: either we hand over Kaliningrad, or we face the consequences of defying their demands. The Soviet Union’s newfound strength and aggressive stance leave us with little room to maneuver. We now face a critical decision: comply with their demand and risk undermining our sovereignty, or resist and potentially provoke a conflict that could destabilize Europe.

Their diplomats are insistent: Poland must surrender these regions or face the consequences. The Soviet Union’s revival has already shifted the balance of power, and their newfound influence cannot be ignored. This demand challenges our sovereignty and threatens to undo the sacrifices we’ve made to maintain our independence.

Their diplomats assure us that by ending the embargo, we will gain access to valuable resources, new markets, and favorable trade agreements. This could help boost our economy and strengthen our position on the global stage. However, the proposal also carries political implications—aligning with the Soviets may shift our standing in the international community, potentially creating tension with other powers.

He works under the name of Goblin.\n\nPolitical ideas of this man are somewhat leftist and generally he supports Soviet Revolution, so it might be useful to hire Goblin and use him as a propaganda tool.

These remnants of the old order, clinging to outdated systems and self-serving practices, have proven to be a formidable obstacle to the sweeping industrial reforms necessary to build a truly planned economy. Their reluctance to embrace change and their inefficiency undermine the unity and progress required for our revolutionary goals.\n\nThis resistance is not merely a logistical challenge but a political struggle against those who fail to see the necessity of aligning industry with the principles of socialism. Overcoming these barriers will require decisive action, purging reactionary influences, and rallying the workforce to the cause of rebuilding a Soviet economy that serves the people, not profit. The path ahead is fraught with difficulty, but our resolve is unwavering. The reorganization of industry will succeed, and the Soviet Union will become a beacon of socialist prosperity once more."

To this end, we have the opportunity to expand the KGB and restore SMERSH, the legendary counterintelligence agency that once served as the shield of the Soviet state. These institutions will be critical in rooting out espionage, dismantling subversive networks, and ensuring the stability of our socialist society.\n\nAt the forefront of this effort is Filipp Bobkov, a seasoned and highly respected KGB operative with unparalleled expertise in counterintelligence. Under his guidance, the reorganization of our security apparatus will be swift and efficient, ensuring that enemies of the revolution find no safe haven. The restoration of SMERSH will remind the world that the Soviet Union is once again a power to be reckoned with, unwavering in its commitment to safeguarding the ideals of socialism.

Disillusioned by the corruption and disarray of the federal forces, many former Russian military commanders have chosen to join the Soviet side, bringing their experience and strategic expertise to our cause.
