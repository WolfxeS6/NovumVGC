 election_SOV.1.d:0 "Boris Yeltsin's long-time rule of Russia has recently ended, with his political protegé Vladimir Putin being made acting president. Especially through his resolute policy regarding Chechnya, the previously unknown Putin generally earned the approval of the Russian public. Now, elections for the office of President are being held, and Putin is looking to have his government confirmed.\n\nThe other candidates include the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky, the neo-Soviet communist Zyuganov and the democratic liberal Yavlinsky."

 russia.1.t:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster"
 russia.1.d:0 "The Kursk Submarine Disaster was a naval incident 75 kilometres north of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. \n\nThe Russian Oscar-class submarine K-141 'Kursk' suffered a faulty weld on a 65-76 practice torpedo, which caused a peroxide explosion and the subsequent detonation of at least 5 torpedo warheads. \n\nThe Russian Naval Command greatly underestimated the situation and declined international help on the basis of crude allegations that NATO might be involved with the sinking. Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

 russia_news.1.d:0 "As was completely predictable, the young political upstart Vladimir Putin, acting president since December 31st, 1999, has been confirmed in his office as President of Russia by popular vote.\n\nPutin was internationally perceived as little more than a puppet who got to power simply because he was Boris Yeltsin's designated political successor, but his recent unforgiving policy on the Chechen insurgency has already proved him to be a more resolute leader than some of his sceptics may expect."

This comes as an absolute shock, as the presidency was already considered pre-determined and won by Vladimir Putin, the designated heir of Boris Yeltsin. It appears Russian elections are less (or far more) rigged than expected."
 russia_news.3.o1:0 "Does that mark the rebirth of the USSR?"
 russia_news.4.t:0 "Grigory Yavlinsky elected President"
 russia_news.4.d:0 "An internationally almost completely unknown political activist, Grigory Yavlinsky, has won the Russian Presidential Election in what can only be described as a political earthquake. The question of Boris Yeltsin's succession was considered answered before it was even asked, with Vladimir Putin clearly favoured among the different candidates. But it appears that the conservative and oligarch-friendly course of Yeltsin's government has not helped Putin's campaign. The Russian people have selected the liberal Yavlinsky instead."

 russ.1.desc:0 "Good day, dear player. This event is meant to tell you possile paths, which Russia has to offer, and their advantages and disadvantages.\n\n1. §CHistorical path.§! It contains focus tree, which you can see right now. Russia has a lot of problems with its military and industry. After dealing with debuffs, you can build military with, perhaps, biggest artillery buffs in the game; special forces are also massively favoured; other military buffs are comparable with what other countries have. Foreign policy branch is centered around unification of post-soviet countries more or less peacefully.\n\n2. §OYavlinsky path.§! It is less interesting and not finished. I woulnt reccomend to play it for now. It contains an opportunity to join NATO and EU. To open this path, you should choose Yavlinsky as president elections winner.\n\n3. §RSoviet path§! offers you massive industry buffs. Note, that it is more of a late-game build, as you will likely suffer in the beginning. Soviet army offers great complience/dealing with resistance opportunities, as well as armor and some other minor buffs. Soviet foreign diplomacy allows you to ignite civil war in post-soviet space and quickly capture Ukraine, Belarus and Kazahstan. In order to unlock this path, you should elect Zyuganov, wait for some time and navigate through decisions."

russ.16.desc:0 "The situation with otkaxniki (refusers) began to heat up a few months ago. Before the war started, there were very few refusals. Most of them were written by officers who had fought in Chechnya and Syria and realized that the approaching war was just another gamble by the Russian authorities. But there were a few dozen such refuseniks for the entire army. They were either offered to resign from the armed forces or, if they had a lot of experience and a rare military specialty, they tried to persuade them to stay or began to threaten them.\n\n"Privates, sergeants, lieutenants. The guys looked at f*cked up situation going on, at the first killed, at the stalled equipment, at the burning columns. They started talking softly about how to return to Russia. There were cases of desertion, there were cases of surrender. In front of the ranks, political patrols were performing, talking about criminal responsibility for desertion, about wartime laws. Then these scary stories were enough to scare people. But whispers went around the companies and platoons about a soldier who surrendered to the Khokhalese in order not to fight, about someone who had successfully escaped and was supposedly already at home,” says a commander of one of the units of the Russian Armed Forces."

The trembling in his hands, which had begun in the general's office, had already passed, but his heart continued to pound like a madman. Involuntarily he listened to every sound of footsteps coming from the corridor, nervously waiting for the denouement - the appearance of “his” investigator.\n\nHe wanted only one thing now - for all this not to happen. He was ready to return to the past, to live his life anew, without making the mistakes he had already made, without bowing to the weaknesses that had pushed him down the path of official crimes. \n\nIgor suddenly thought that the changes that might soon take place in his life would become unbearable for him. He didn't want to return to a life that didn't have the opportunities he had now. Then maybe it would be better to... shoot himself? "

If this could be tolerated in peacetime, it could not be tolerated during the war.\n\nThose responsible for the failures of the first days of the war were arrested. Many were sent to the front “to atone for their sins with blood”. Gradually, patriotic officers filled the vacant positions, and foreign intelligence gradually began to work properly."

This transformation came through a blend of focused leadership, strategic diplomacy, and careful rebuilding of economy. Leaders prioritized strengthening national identity, investing in education and technological innovation, and reviving key industries, which laid the foundation for a resilient and prosperous nation. With stability came a strong network of international allies, whose support was vital in securing peaceful negotiations to reclaim historical lands.\n\nThe people, united by a shared history and vision, rallied around this cause, fostering a deep sense of national pride and purpose. Gradually, territories that had once been symbols of loss and struggle were peacefully re-integrated, bringing back cherished cultural and historical landmarks. This period of restoration marked a defining chapter in the nation's history, demonstrating that through resilience, unity, and strategic vision, a nation can rise to reclaim not only its lands but also its rightful place on the world stage."

russ.22.desc:0 "Despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States continues policies aimed at weakening Russia. We tried to be friends with Western world. As a result we lost half of our country, our national pride, we refused communist ideology. We proposed peace. Nevertheless, NATO expands toward Russia’s borders, USA supports anti-Russian sentiments and regime changes in neighboring states.\n\nWe proposed friendship, but they refused.Now it is time for Russia to revive its national unity and to think about its own interests.\n\nYes, we are occupiers. Once Russia occupied Siberia. Now there are mines and oil rigs. Now there are cities and kindergartens and hospitals. Now you can't sell women there for a bundle of sable pelts, as it was before the Russians.\nWe occupied Central Asia. In the bare steppes, we built canals, factories, cosmodromes, schools and stadiums. There we produced space rockets and airplanes, developed industry, grew wheat and cotton for the whole country. I was asked to leave. Now hemp is being grown there with the help of American loans, and part of the population has gone to work on the construction sites of the former occupiers.\n\nYes, we are an occupiers, and we are tired of apologizing for it. We have our own values and we do not care about West anymore. Russia has its own interests."
