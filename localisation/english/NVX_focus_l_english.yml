 PRC_peaceful_rise:0 "Peaceful Rise"
 PRC_peaceful_rise_desc:0 "As China grows to become a true superpower we can begin to project our influence here in Asia and further abroad. The military is but a blunt instrument; our diplomacy and economic power will make us the true Master of the Pacific."
 PRC_china_dream:0 "China Dream"

 PRC_military_reorganization_desc:0 "New tactics and technologies have changed the modern battlefield and the Chinese army must adapt to be ready for future conflict."
 PRC_anti_corruption:0 "Anti-Corruption Measures"
 PRC_anti_corruption_desc:0 "As much as our state media denies it, communist governments tend to be pretty corrupt. This is especially so in China, as the recent growth in the economy has allowed thousands of nameless ministers to illegally enrich themselves with profits that should be going to the Party. Of course, while we are going about arresting the men skimming off the top, we can make a big public campaign about it. The people will think more money will be spent on them now, and that should keep them happy."
 PRC_industrial_safety:0 "Industrial Safety Laws"
 PRC_industrial_safety_desc:0 "What allowed us to become the modern workshop of the world was allowing our people to work in brutal conditions no western nation would accept, and all for virtually no pay. As much as the more benevolent men within the Party might want to change this, doing so would weaken China’s position as a rising superpower. Still, we can offer minor concessions and make sure people know all about what the government is doing to protect them. That should calm down any thoughts of protesting their conditions."
 PRC_educational_development:0 "Education Development"
 PRC_educational_development_desc:0 "China is a very large nation, both in area and population. Because of this, our education system isn’t the best. Our schools tend to be underfunded and undermanned, cheating is rampant, and our constant demands for political indoctrination seem to be getting in the way of proper learning. If we wish to take the mantle of leading world power from the Americans, we need to begin to address these concerns to make our education system the finest in the world. Except for the political indoctrination. That stays."
 PRC_communications_network:0 "Communications Networks"
 PRC_public_services:0 "Public Services"
 PRC_public_services_desc:0 "Our cities are massively inefficient. Traffic Jams may last days on end, trash tends to pile up, and pollution is high. Beginning some investments in improving public services in major cities should improve the efficiency of local governments, increasing the available resources for us in the Central Government to spend on other things."
 PRC_research_initiatives:0 "Research Initiatives"
 PRC_research_initiatives_desc:0 "Frankly, it is insulting to the Chinese spirit that most modern science comes from the Western World. Our various reforms have begun improving the Chinese education system, but more needs to be done. We should set up a program with very large rewards, both monetary and otherwise, for Chinese researchers who make scientific breakthroughs. Our nation is massive, surely we have one Steven Hawking or two around somewhere to compete with the West."
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives:0 "Diplomatic Initiatives"
 PRC_diplomatic_initatives_desc:0 "Our economic might, and ideological differences from the west, will allow us to gain many allies in nations that do not feel comfortable with the current world order.

 PRC_trade_deals:0 "International Trade Deals"
 PRC_trade_deals_desc:0 "The west might not like to acknowledge it, but most nations outside of Europe and North America only align with them for financial reasons.

 PRC_educational_exchanges:0 "Educational Exchanges"
 PRC_educational_exchanges_desc:0 "There are a whole lot of countries out there, and that means a whole lot of students. We should help our Universities do Educational Exchange Programs, to send our students abroad and welcome foreigners to our country. Not only will the students bring in new knowledge from the outside world, but the foreigners we welcome will spread good words about China back home."
 PRC_economic_liberalization:0 "Economic Liberalisation"
 PRC_economic_liberalization_desc:0 "It seems that not many countries are happy with doing educational exchanges with China, or cooperating with Chinese companies, while the government maintains absolute control. Perhaps we should pass some reforms to loosen our control in the economy, to incentivize people more and give ourselves a better image overseas."
 PRC_free_markets:0 "Free Markets"
 PRC_free_markets_desc:0 "Well, our recent economics reforms have pushed for new demands from our young private sector. Several would-be businessmen, no doubt influenced by outside ideas, have presented the government with a brand new reformed system for our control of the economy. Basically, we will allow quasi free market economic actions to take place inside the country, but the government will retain total authority in any exchange involving a foreign party. Not only will this discredit foreign propaganda about our totalitarianism, it will increase the efficiency of our economy much more."
 PRC_african_initiatives:0 "African Initiatives"
 PRC_african_initiatives_desc:0 "The nations of Africa have been impoverished for centuries. Not many nations really prospered by European or Asian standards, and their time as European Colonies, while certainly helpful for their modernization, didn’t help them develop too much. It's been decades since decolonization, and many nations’ infrastructures are in disrepair, relying on old colonial roads and railways. If we begin organising investment funds for several of these nations, we will have gained many new friends."
 PRC_east_african_trade:0 "East African Trade"
 PRC_east_african_trade_desc:0 "Eastern Africa is often ignored by the west, and the nations of the region would be very grateful to have the option to trade with China directly. We should draft proposals for trade agreements with Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda."
 PRC_east_african_development:0 "East African Development"
 PRC_east_african_development_desc:0 "Our new African Partners are very grateful for our proposals, but they cynically still think this is little more than us taking advantage of their poor position. We should show them our goodwill by helping them develop. Let’s modernise their railways and manufacturing capabilities. We should send some industrial engineers to take core of this, have the Interior Ministry of Industry compile a list of candidates, and we will send them abroad."
 PRC_south_african_trade:0 "South African Trade"
 PRC_south_african_trade_desc:0 "The southern tip of the African Continent is in an especially poor situation. Besides the nation of South Africa, the other nations in the region have been plagued by war and poverty, and they would very much welcome sudden investments from Beijing into their countries. South Africa itself probably would like it too."
 PRC_south_african_development:0 "South African Development"
 PRC_south_african_development_desc:0 "We set up some symbolic operations that will help our partners on their day to day running of their countries, but we need to do more to secure their loyalty. Modernising their roads, building railways, and bringing some small manufacturing to the region will have them kissing our feet."
 PRC_african_mining_interests:0 "African Mining Interests"
 PRC_african_mining_interests_desc:0 "The Europeans colonised Africa because of its massive natural wealth. Colonisation has gone out of style, but we can very easily help our African Partners set up better mining operations in exchange for very beneficial trade deals with us. Functionally, we will control their resources, all while looking good internationally and not firing a single bullet. Let's prepare investment plans."
 PRC_alliance_expansion:0 "Alliance Expansion"
 PRC_alliance_expansion_desc:0 "Our actions in Africa have gained us new friends, but this is of little use until we formulate our relationship. We should officially invite our African Partners into our Alliance."
 PRC_multilateral_negotiation:0 "Multilateral Negotiation"

 PRC_regional_agreements:0 "Regional Agreements"
 PRC_regional_agreements_desc:0 "Our neighbours are often neglected by the west, so we are in a great position to extend our hand to them, and set ourselves up as the 'Policeman of Asia'. Let's prepare some diplomatic statements for our neighbouring Asian nations."
 PRC_asian_alliance:0 "Asian Alliance"
 PRC_asian_alliance_desc:0 "NATO and CSTO rule the world now, but China will beat them both. We need to set up our own alliance. The Asian Economic and Defense Union will be the alliance of the future. Let's send the proposal and an invitation to Hanoi and Pyongyang."
 PRC_taiwan_association_agreement:0 "Taiwan Association Agreement"
 PRC_taiwan_association_agreement_desc:0 "If we intend to maintain civil relations with Taiwan, we cannot risk them having a de facto different military allegiance than the mainland. We should invite them to the AEDU."
 PRC_international_arbitration:0 "International Arbitration"
 PRC_international_arbitration_desc:0 "We have lots of issues with our neighbours, and many conflicts. Some within the Party suggest its time the PLA set the world aflame, and secure its rightful place as the true superpower. These people have been stripped of all power. Let's solve our problems with diplomatic arbitration instead."
 PRC_taiwan_concensus:0 "Taiwan Consensus"
 PRC_taiwan_concensus_desc:0 "The issue of Taiwan has been a constant pain for the government. On the one hand, we really want them gone and Chinese Taipei under our control. On the other hand, we don't want to start WWIII. Let's get the international community to help us solve our problems with them."
 PRC_open_communications:0 "Open Communications"

 PRC_one_country_two_systems:0 "One Country Two Systems"
 PRC_one_country_two_systems_desc:0 "The Foreign Ministry thinks they have come up with a potential solution to the Taiwan problem: Chinese Taipei will be allowed to have its government and run its internal affairs as they please, and in return, they will treat us as the de facto legitimate government of China, and they will not attempt to declare independence. We should propose this to them."

First, they had the audacity to fight us in a war after they threatened our Cambodian allies. Then, they aligned themselves with Moscow over us, and now, long after the USSR is gone, they seem like they wish to align themselves with the west! We cannot tolerate this.

However, the truth about modern warfare and the politics of Great Powers, is that power projection is just as important as actual military might, and, unfortunately for us, power is best projected by a strong navy. We must begin to expand the Navy immediately, and building new ports and dockyards in the southernmost region of Hainan will be a great start.

 PRC_central_military_industry:0 "Central Military Industry"
 PRC_central_military_industry_desc:0 "It, of course, makes the most sense to produce our equipment in bigger cities, but moving our military production away from the centres of consumer products manufacturing means that, in the event China is ever invaded, or our military production suffers from sabotage, some production will remain safe and stable.

 DEN_expand_Holmen:0 "Expand Holmen"
 DEN_expand_Holmen_desc:0 "Naval Base Copenhagen, more commonly known as Naval Base Holmen, is our first and largest naval base, dating from the 17th century. Even though it originally occupied the entirety of the water-bound neighbourhood Holmen in Copenhagen, it has since then been reduced to the island of Nyholm. We need to expand the naval base back to its original capacity, even if it will disappoint the many daily visitors."

 DEN_refurbish_royal_naval_academy_desc:0 "At an age of more than 300 years, the Royal Danish Naval Academy has the honour of being the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world.

 DEN_early_fighter_models:0 "Early Fighter Models"

 DEN_refurbish_air_force_officers_school_desc:0 "The Royal Danish Air Force Officers School is the youngest of our great military academies, but is still lagging hopelessly behind other countries' air forces.

 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base:0 "Expand Skalstrup Air Base"
 DEN_Skalstrup_air_base_desc:0 "Our air base near Roskilde was previously armed with NIKE rockets and HAWK batteries that contributed massively to our anti-air capabilities in Zealand and whose prime directive was the protection of Copenhagen from air bombardments.

 DEN_air_doctrine_2:0 "Air Doctrine II"
 DEN_air_doctrine_2_desc:0 "Now that our air doctrine initiatives are well underway we can divert some of our greatest military minds to support the development of innovative new ways of ruling the skies."
 DEN_Karup_air_base:0 "Expand Karup Air Base"
 DEN_Karup_air_base_desc:0 "Karup in Jutland is home to our largest Air Base, not only the largest in Denmark but the largest in all of Northern Europe. As the pride and joy of our Air Force it reinforces the fact that even though we're a geographically small nation we're more than capable of punching above our weight class. Karup needs to be protected, to be respected - and perhaps even to be expanded."
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production:0 "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc:0 "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircrafts for the Air Force home.

 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps:0 "Mobilise the Hunter Corps"
 DEN_mobilize_hunter_corps_desc:0 "The Hunter Corps, or 'Jægerkorpset' in Danish, is our main special operations force. Their motto, 'Plus esse, quam simultatur', 'More to be than to seem' refers to their understated, humble appearance. Almost nothing is known about the Hunter Corps, or its members, in the Danish public, which keeps the enemies of the country guessing about their true capabilities."
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen:0 "Mobilise the Frogmen"
 DEN_mobilize_frogmen_desc:0 "The Frogmen Corps, or in Danish 'Frømandskorpset', is our maritime special operations force. The Frogmen Corps has extremely exclusive selection training, as seen in the fact that since the Corps was founded in 1957 there has only been a little more than 300 Frogmen - in total. As the elite forces of our strongest military branch, they are a must-have in any enemy encounter."
 DEN_sirius_patrol:0 "The Sirius Patrol"
 DEN_sirius_patrol_desc:0 "The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol is one of the most elite units in the Danish Naval Forces, tasked with long-distance reconnaissance and asserting Danish sovereignty in the most remote parts of the Arctic.

 DEN_abolish_amts_desc:0 "Many parts of Denmark have room for improvement, but in order to get to that we first need to deal with one of the biggest obstacles for innovation and modernization.

Their close cooperation will be essential for our future plans."
 DEN_empower_regions:0 "Empower the Regions"
 DEN_empower_regions_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that the problem with the amts was that they weren't large enough to be of any real use. Instead we should create a new system of a few administrative Danish 'regions' each spanning a large part of Denmark. This would ensure greater focus on large cities as funding isn't swallowed by minor, irrelevant outskirts."
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits:0 "Natural Gas Deposits"
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits_desc:0 "The North Sea is a treasure trove of natural resources. Chief among these are the large deposits of natural gas - if we can renovate the high pressure transmission lines connecting to them it would take some of the pressure off the rest of our energy sources."
 DEN_revitalize_the_outskirts:0 "Revitalise the Outskirts"
 DEN_revitalize_the_outskirts_desc:0 "A large number of municipalities are struggling to maintain their population as more and more people move to the big cities, and have asked for our help.

 DEN_expand_central_government:0 "Expand the Central Government"

 DEN_north_sea_oil:0 "North Sea Oil"
 DEN_north_sea_oil_desc:0 "A multinational consortium is currently heading the production of oil from our vast deposits in the North Sea, and Denmark is getting a ridiculously low cut of the action.

 DEN_urban_improvement_fund:0 "Urban Improvement Fund"
 DEN_urban_improvement_fund_desc:0 "Most of our population today live in our large cities, with more than 20% of our entire population in Copenhagen alone.

 DEN_windmill_parks:0 "Windmill Parks"

Iceland extended its 3 nautical miles of exclusive economic area (1952) all the way to 200 nautical miles (1976). Perhaps a few reforms are in order to appease the UK."

Especially the Crisis of the 90s, when GDP dropped by 5% at the beginning of the decade, scarred the once untouchable Swedish money machine. The 1994 budget had a deficit of 15% of the GDP.

 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act_desc:0 "The Monetary Control Act was part of an Act passed in 1980, which opened the discount window for the Fed enabling a host of financial institutions to borrow from the Federal Reserve.

 USA_revive_michigan:0 "Revive Michigan"
 USA_revive_michigan_desc:0 "Michigan used to be known as the centre of the automotive industry, but the state today is a husk of its former self, with cities such as Detroit struggling under a stagnant economy.
