 congo.1.t:0 "Laurent Kabila's Child Soldiers"
 congo.1.d:0 "President Laurent-Désiré Kabila relies on a large body of child-soldier bodyguards, know as Kadogos,for his personal protection, with the DRC employing upwards of 10000 conscripted minors, comprising a significant percentage of our militias. This is being increasingly condemned by the international community, and, while one of the alleged main reasons to recruit child soldiers is their supposed loyalkty, many in government, including Kabila himself, are starting to suspect that the kadogos are involved insome kind of conspiracy against the president.\n So the question of the child soldiers remain\: Should the kadogos be dismissed or are they still necessary for the war effort against Uganda and Rwanda?"

The assassin was an 18-year-old boy soldier, a kadogo, and there are strong indications that the murder was the result of a conspiracy by the kadogos. Laurent's son, Joseph Kabila succeeded his father to the presidency at the young age of 29."

Professor Wamba Dia Wamba, after seeing his position collapse and surviving multiple assassination attempts, was ousted by Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi, who renamed the movment as \"Rally for Congolese Democracy - Kisangani - Movement for Liberation\".

As enemy rebel forces disarm and DRC forces move into the Kivu region in Eastern Congo in order to crush the radical Hutu FDLR militias, former RCD military commanders, chief among them Laurent Nkunda, refused to accept the peace terms and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), launching an insurgency in the region, probably with assistance from their former benefactors, the Rwandans."

 congo.16.d:0 "A minor change was proposed to the national flag. A blue field with a small yellow star, situated in the top corner of the hoist side, with a red, yellow-lined band running diagonally across the center. While the blue field with a yellow star is a symbol of the Congo since the days of Leopold II, this flag was resignified so that the red symbolized the people's blood; the yellow symbolized prosperity; the blue symbolized hope; and the star represented unity. A design very similar to the proposed one was used after the Congo Crisis, from roughly 1993 to 1971, when Mobutu renamed the country Zaire"
