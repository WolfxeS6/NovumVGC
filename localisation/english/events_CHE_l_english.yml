 chechnya.1.t:0 "Akhmad Kadyrov offers his support against [CHE.GetNameDef]"
 chechnya.1.d:0 "Akhmad Kadyrov, leader of Chechnya's pro-Russian faction, has requested a secret meeting with our officials. In a tense exchange, he offers his support in the ongoing war against Chechen separatists in return for a significant price: the right to rule Chechnya as its new leader under Russia’s protection. Kadyrov’s terms would give us an ally on the ground, but at the cost of granting him power in the region. While Kadyrov’s offer could end the insurgency in Chechnya, we cannot ignore the risks of empowering him as a leader under our control. Should we accept his terms, it may solidify our influence over the region—but it could also spark further unrest among those who resist our presence."
 chechnya.1.a:0 "Install an loyal regime"
 chechnya.1.b:0 "Rule the territory directly"
 chechnya.2.t:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] accepts our proposal"
 chechnya.2.d:0 "Our proposal has been accepted. With Moscow’s backing, we will assume leadership in Chechnya under Russian oversight. Though this arrangement limits our autonomy, it secures our position and ensures stability in the aftermath of the conflict. From this foundation, we can begin shaping the republic’s future — with the Kremlin’s blessing."
 chechnya.2.a:0 "We will rebuild Chechnya to former glory!"
 chechnya.3.t:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] refuses any cooperation"
 chechnya.3.d:0 "The Kremlin has declined our offer. Despite our willingness to cooperate and ensure post-war stability, Moscow sees no place for our leadership in Chechnya’s future. This refusal is a clear message — we are not part of their plans. Our next steps must be taken carefully, as the path ahead grows uncertain."
 chechnya.3.a:0 "Let's see how they manage that alone"
 chechnya.4.t:0 "Chechnyans Return to Normal Life"
 chechnya.4.d:0 "The war has ended, and Russian forces have begun dismantling our wartime infrastructure. Arms workshops across the country have been shut down and are being converted into civilian industries under tight supervision. In Grozny, the Russian flag now flies over official buildings, a visible sign of occupation. Civilians are cautiously returning, and traces of normal life are beginning to reemerge — but with much of the country in ruins, full recovery remains a distant goal."
 chechnya.4.a:0 "Lets see how long that will last"
 chechnya.5.t:0 "Chechen insurgents continue armed resistance"
 chechnya.5.d:0 "Reports from the southern districts of [ROOT.GetName] confirm that armed bands have resumed operations in the mountainous terrain near Vedeno and Shatoy. Ambushes on convoys, attacks on isolated outposts, and the appearance of propaganda leaflets suggest a coordinated effort to reignite the insurgency. Despite our recent stabilization efforts and continued support from [SOV.GetNameDef], pockets of resistance remain entrenched and emboldened."
 chechnya.5.a:0 "So much to peace in the region..."
 chechnya.6.t:0 "Victory Declared in Chechnya"
 chechnya.6.d:0 "Federal forces have completed their sweep of remaining resistance strongholds in the southern highlands. Grozny, once reduced to rubble by street-to-street fighting, now flies the tricolor again. Militants have either been eliminated, driven into the mountains, or surrendered under pressure from loyalist intermediaries.\n\nIn a display of confidence and control, Acting President Vladimir Putin personally flew aboard a Su-27 fighter jet to a military base in Chechnya, symbolizing the restored sovereignty of the Russian state over the breakaway republic. The move, widely publicized, has galvanized national pride and underscored the return of centralized authority.\n\nThough isolated attacks still occur, Moscow now considers the main phase of the counter-terrorist operation concluded. Reconstruction efforts are underway, and a new local administration loyal to the Kremlin has been installed. For the first time in years, the road to Grozny is open — and it leads back to Moscow."
 chechnya.6.a:0 "Order has been restored"
 chechnya.7.t:0 "A Trailblazer Falls Silent"
 chechnya.7.d:0 "Lyalya Nasukhanova, the first Chechen woman pilot and a decorated flight instructor, dies at the age of 61 while living as a refugee in North Ossetia. With over 2,500 flight hours on Yakovlev and MiG aircraft and more than 100 parachute jumps, she broke barriers in Soviet aviation. In 1964, she became the first woman in the USSR to command a jet fighter echelon. After 23 years in aviation, she transitioned to public service and politics. Despite applying four times to join the Soviet cosmonaut corps, her background as a former exile prevented her admission. Her death occurs during the Second Chechen War, far from her birthplace in Chechnya."
 chechnya.7.a:0 "Her legacy will inspire new pilots"

 chechnya.100.t:0 "Outpost Struck by Insurgents"
 chechnya.100.d:0 "In the early hours before dawn, a Russian forward operating base near Kurchaloy came under sudden mortar and small arms fire. The attackers, believed to be insurgents operating out of the nearby forest belt, struck swiftly and withdrew before reinforcements could arrive. Initial reports confirm several casualties among the stationed troops, with ammunition stores damaged in the ensuing blaze."
 chechnya.100.a:0 "Hunt them down"
 chechnya.100.b:0 "Hunt them down"

 CHE_kadyrov_as_puppet_tt:0 "We will install §YAkhmad Kadyrov§! as a loyal leader in Chechnya and release the country as a §Ypuppet§! after the war ends."
