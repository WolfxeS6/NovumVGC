By 2010, opinion polls routinely suggested that Labor would not be able to win the next election if it continued on this path. According to ABC's 7:30 Report', the seeds for Gillard to challenge candidate Rudd were sown by "Victorian Right factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten MP and Senator David Feeney, who had between them secured the support of "New South Wales power broker" Mark Arbib. Feeney and Arbib discussed the matter of a potential leadership challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and began a numbers count to establish the feasibility of a leadership challenge. The pair found that there was more than enough support for Gillard for the challenge to proceed. The declining ratings for both the Labor Party and Rudd personally were attributed to many factors, including problems with the Home Insulation Program, a significant delay to a planned carbon emissions reduction scheme, a move to introduce mandatory internet filtering, the proposed introduction of the Resource Super Profits Tax, and the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. Senior Labour MPs conceded that the ALP's primary vote had dropped below 30% in some key marginal seats, a figure which if replicated at a federal election would have seen a Labor defeat."

Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at door stops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down.

On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters.

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00 pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

 britain_decision.1.d:0 "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighbouring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonised by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Malvinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favour could be good in the long run..."

The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatising and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparently belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages.

 mauritania.2.t:0 "New Flag Proposal"
 mauritania.2.d:0 "Our ruling party has proposed to amend the national flag by the addition of a thin red stripe at the top and bottom. These stripes symbolise the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory. The proposal was part of a more general project of institutional reform presented during the Conference on Inclusive Dialogue. [Root.GetLeader]'s proposed reform also included the adoption of a new national anthem and the proclamation of a 'Second Republic'."

Currently the referendum to pass proposals put forward at the Conference is slated for late 2016, but if the National Assembly has trouble going forward, it could be pushed into 2017."

The decision was revealed just yesterday during a joint press conference. Now scheduled for early 2017, the national vote seeks approval of several decisions taken during the political dialogue, itself boycotted by the overwhelming majority of opposition parties. Mauritanians are called upon, among others, to advise on the abolition of the Senate and certain institutions, the creation of regional councils and changes to national symbols."
 mauritania.4.o1:0 "Disgraceful."
 mauritania.5.t:0 "Referendum Cancelled"
 mauritania.5.d:0 "Announced with great pomp by President [Root.GetLeader] himself, the popular referendum to approve constitutional changes contained in the resolutions of the national inclusive dialogue from October will ultimately not take place. These changes included radical moves to abolish the senate, create decentralised regional councils and modify the flag and national anthem. This change of high importance, revealed at the end of a meeting between the President and senators, still arouses a stir. Thus, in place of popular consultation, the Mauritanian authorities decided to limit themselves to the vote of the Parliament sitting in congress to validate the reforms. This decision is motivated mostly by a supposedly 'difficult economic situation', a truth that the President himself now seems to recognise."
 mauritania.5.o1:0 "To Parliament it is then."
 mauritania.6.t:0 "Debate Begins in National Assembly"
 mauritania.6.d:0 "The debate on constitutional changes has begun in our lower house, the National Assembly.

 mauritania.8.d:0 "The National Assembly in its plenary session yesterday, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Mohamedould Boilil, adopted by secret vote Constitutional Bill 118/17, revising the 1991 constitution of Mauritania and its amending texts. During the debate, members of our lower house discussed the legality of the proposed revision, the national flag 'improvements', the abolition of the Senate and various other amendments that President [Root.GetLeader] and his ruling party hope to enact sooner rather than later. For our head of state, this is certainly a great victory. However, the bill must still pass through the Senate or else it will surely go to a national referendum as initially suggested."

 mauritania.9.d:0 "Mauritania's senate rejected a contentious constitutional amendment on its own abolition and the alteration of the national flag to better represent those who battled for independence from France. 33 Senators out of 56 voted against the package, the President of the Senate stated not long ago. The rejection comes after lawmakers in our lower house passed the proposed measures more than a week ago, with full support from the ruling party. The amendment is therefore definitively defeated by the upper house, and hence it is up to the President to decide whether to continue by way of a referendum."

The proposal to modify the constitution, which has been in force since 1991, was approved by lawmakers in the lower house but rejected by senators earlier this month. 'Due to this rejection, we have arrived at an impasse. But there is one way out: we will hold a referendum', said President [Root.GetLeader] at a press conference. The government has a majority in both chambers, but 24 ruling party senators voted against the measure, highlighting what the President said was a 'dysfunction in our democracy'."
 mauritania.10.o1:0 "To the polls it is!"
 mauritania.11.t:0 "Referendum Campaign Begins"
 mauritania.11.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader] launched a campaign on Friday for a constitutional referendum boycotted by opposition figures who call the vote a smokescreen to keep the ruling party in power. The boycott movement draws broad political support from Islamists and anti-slavery activists, all of whom oppose measures including abolishing the Senate and changing the national flag. More than 1.4 million Mauritanians are eligible to vote on the constitutional changes, set to be voted on in the very near future."
 mauritania.11.o1:0 "Ok."
 mauritania.12.t:0 "Referendum Succeeds"
 mauritania.12.d:0 "On a turnout of 53.73 percent of the 1.4 million Mauritanians eligible to vote, 85 percent yesterday voted 'yes' to abolition of the Senate and changes to the country's flag, the national electoral commission said today. President Aziz said the changes would bring our nation 'peace, security, stability and development' and said the boycott movement existed 'only on paper and social media'. The opposition has stated it would not recognise the results of this referendum, denouncing it in a statement today as an electoral farce, also adding that people had 'clearly rejected the constitutional amendments'. Nevertheless, the ruling party's goal has finally been achieved and Mauritania can be placed back on the path of progress towards a stronger future amongst countless threats."

Bondevik's government tried to prevent the construction of the environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable energy sources, whereas the opposition of social democrats and hardline conservatives had supported the construction project.\n\nBondevik's government, due to its minority status, lost the motion of confidence that inevitably ensued and Kjell Magne Bondevik was forced to resign as Prime Minister of Norway.

 olympic_games.2.d:0 "The 19th Olympic Winter Games were held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from February 8th to February 24th, 2002.\nSalt Lake City's 1995 bid for the 2002 games clearly defeated all other contestants, winning the bid in the first round. It would mark the 8th time the United States hosted the Olympics, after St. Louis 1904, Los Angeles 1932, Lake Placid 1932, Squaw Valley 1960, Lake Placid 1980, Los Angeles 1984 and Atlanta 1996.\n\n78 nations took part, with Cameroon, Hong Kong, Nepal, Tajikistan and Thailand participating in the Winter Games for the first time.

 olympic_games.3.t:0 "2004 Athens Olympics"
 olympic_games.3.d:0 "When Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympic Games in 1896, he did so in Athens; a fact that would be the basis for the tradition that the Greek athletes are always the first to enter an Olympic Stadium during its opening ceremony. Some Greeks back then were unhappy with the fact that the Olympic Games moved to France in 1900 and the USA in 1904 and thus even held an unofficial Olympics in 1906, again in Athens. This contest however went unrecognised and it would take until August 13th, 2004 for the the Olympic Games to once again return to its founding city: Athens, Greece.\nThe 28th Olympic Summer Games were the first summer contest since 1992 to once again take place in Europe and were dominated by the United States (34/39/27), China (32/17/14) and Russia (28/26/38)."

A surprisingly strong nation was South Korea, coming in seventh (6/3/2) and sending both the most successful male and female athlete, Ahn Hyun-soo (3 Golds, 1 Bronze) and Jin Sun-yu (3 Golds), both competing in Short track."
 olympic_games.5.t:0 "2008 Beijing Olympics"
 olympic_games.5.d:0 "Giving the olympic nomination to the authoritarian Chinese government was more than controversial, as the 29th Olympic Summer Games might give the Chinese a propaganda opportunity. Indeed, the contest became the biggest and most expensive competition in Olympic history. 43 World Records and 132 Olympic Records were set and an unprecedented 86 nations won at least one medal. China, the most successful nation, won an impressive 47 Gold Medals, again setting another record. The United States, coming in second, won an overall 111 medals, again unprecedented. The games were called into question by Tibetans the world over, pointing to the suppression of their people by the Chinese government. Most notable athlete of the games was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who dominated the Track & Field contests."

The Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ghana, Pakistan and Peru participated for the first time; Montenegro and Serbia made an appearance as divided countries for the first time.\nCanada came in first, winning 26 medals (14/7/5), even though runner-up Germany (10/13/7) and third place United States (9/15/13) won more medals overall."

Brazil came in thirteenth, behind the Netherlands and Hungary.\nFiji became a fan favourite when its Rugby Sevens won the gold, the first ever olympic medal in Fiji's history."

 olympic_games.12.d:0 "Beijing was to become the first city to host both the Summer and the Winter Games, after hosting the Summer Games of 2008 and now the Winter Games of 2022.\nChina, as expected, did well, even though the nature of the winter games took some of their usually dominated summer sports away from them. Scandinavian, American, German, Austrian and French athletes also performed exceptionally well. 2022 became the first Winter Games since 2010 in which China's ally North Korea attended."

Many other European nations do not give such a position to a particular church body. This, in the eyes of critics, does not only discriminate against foreigners of non-Christian belief, but also the small catholic and orthodox communities of Sweden.\n\nThere is no real power held by the Church of Sweden anymore.
