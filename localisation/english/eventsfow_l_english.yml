Despite enduring the upheavals of both world wars, the shipyard persevered, albeit witnessing numerous changes in ownership and name over time. However, following Estonia's attainment of independence, its operational activities gradually diminished, ultimately leading to Noblessner filing for bankruptcy.\n\nCurrently, the BLTR Group has expressed interest in integrating the shipyard into its corporate portfolio.
