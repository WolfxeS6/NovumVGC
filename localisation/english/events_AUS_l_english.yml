austria.1.t:0 "The Klima Situation"
austria.1.d:0 "Amidst mounting political pressures and the loss of votes in the 1999 parliamentary(Nationalrats) election, Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima is thinking about retirement or conceding to the Austrian People's Party's (ÖVP) demands for control over the Financial Ministry. This critical decision comes at an important moment in Austria's political landscape, with significant implications for the nation's future. Rumors of Klima's potential retirement have sparked discussions within the SPÖ and among political analysts, speculating on the future direction of the party and the government. If Klima steps down, it could lead to a significant reshuffling within the SPÖ and potentially alter the balance of power in Austrian politics. If Klima retires, the ÖVP and FPÖ will form a conservative government or if Klima gives in, this move could drastically hurt the SPÖ's image and harm the party in the long run."
austria.1.o1:0 "The People have spoken."
austria.1.o2:0 "We have to give in to stop the FPÖ."
austria.2.t:0 "The Bündnis Zukunft Österreich"
austria.2.d:0 "In a crucial moment within Austrian politics, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (Bündnis Zukunft Österreich, BZÖ) has been founded, marking a new chapter in the country's political landscape. The BZÖ was established by former members of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), led by Jörg Haider, a prominent and controversial political figure. The BZÖ aims to distinguish itself from its parent party by advocating for a more pragmatic approach to policy-making, emphasizing economic reform, modernization, a balanced stance on social issues and nationalism. The party's founders have expressed a commitment to addressing the challenges of globalization, improving Austria's competitiveness, and ensuring social cohesion. Whether or not this new party will succeed has to be seen."
austria.2.o1:0 "No more Haider in the FPÖ."
austria.3.t:0 "The Donnerstagdemonstrationen"
austria.3.d:0 "Tens of thousands of Austrians flooded the streets of Vienna today in the first of what is expected to be a series of weekly protests, known as the Donnerstagsdemonstrationen (Thursday Demonstrations), in response to the newly formed coalition government between the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). The protests were triggered by the swearing-in of the controversial coalition, led by Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel of the ÖVP and Jörg Haider’s FPÖ, just a day earlier. Haider, who has long been criticized for his nationalist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, is seen as a divisive figure, and the inclusion of his party in the government has raised concerns both domestically and internationally. Carrying banners with slogans like “No to Racism” and “Stop the Far-Right,” protesters from across Austrian society marched through the capital’s streets, demanding the government’s dissolution. The peaceful demonstration was the first of what organizers say will be weekly protests every Thursday until the coalition is dissolved."
austria.3.o1:0 "They'll stop in just two weeks, right?."
austria.4.t:0 "The Knittelfeld Putsch"
austria.4.d:0 "Tensions within the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) have reached a boiling point today, as party members gather in the town of Knittelfeld for a critical meeting that could decide the future of its leadership and direction. Dissatisfaction has been growing among FPÖ hardliners, who accuse the party’s leadership, particularly Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer and Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, of betraying the party’s populist roots by compromising too much within the ruling coalition with the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). The meeting in Knittelfeld, led by a faction of party rebels loyal to Jörg Haider, has turned into a dramatic showdown. Key figures are openly challenging the current leadership, demanding a return to the party’s more hardline nationalist positions. As the discussions continue behind closed doors, the atmosphere is tense. Supporters of both sides have gathered outside the meeting venue, anxiously awaiting the outcome of what many are calling a defining moment for the FPÖ."
austria.4.o1:0 "Riess-Passer resigns and Haupt is Obmann."
austria.4.o2:0 "Riess-Passer resigns and Haider is Obmann."
austria.4.o3:0 "Support for Haider has died."
austria.5.t:0 "2002 Nationalrats Election"
austria.5.d:0 "Austrians are voting today in a snap election for the National Council, following the collapse of the ÖVP-FPÖ coalition. The election is seen as a key turning point for Austria’s future, with Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel's Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) leading in the polls. Schüssel, whose controversial partnership with the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) sparked international criticism, hopes to consolidate power, but faces strong competition from the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), led by Alfred Gusenbauer. Key campaign issues include the economy, welfare reform, and Austria’s role in the European Union. The FPÖ, weakened by internal strife and Jörg Haider’s departure, may lose ground, while smaller parties like The Greens could play a decisive role in coalition negotiations. The results, expected later tonight, will determine whether Schüssel’s ÖVP holds on to power or if a new coalition emerges in Austria’s fragmented political landscape."
austria.5.o1:0 "ÖVP-FPÖ again!"
austria.5.o2:0 "ÖVP-SPÖ, same chancellor, different policies!"
austria.5.o3:0 "FPÖ-ÖVP, a far-right drift!"
austria.5.o4:0 "Grüne-ÖVP, green conservative dominance!"
austria.5.o5:0 "SPÖ-ÖVP, a social democratic change!"
austria.5.o6:0 "LIF-ÖVP, a liberal austria!"

austria.5.9:0 "Socialism in Austria!"
austria.6.t:0 "Jörg Haider meets Saddam Hussein!"
austria.6.d:0 "Far-right politician Jörg Haider sparked outrage today with a high-profile visit to Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. Haider, governor of Carinthia and former leader of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), met with the Iraqi dictator amid rising tensions over Iraq’s defiance of U.N. resolutions. Haider presented his visit as a peace mission, claiming to advocate for diplomacy and criticizing U.S. sanctions on Iraq. However, his meeting with Saddam and praise for Iraq’s leadership drew sharp criticism both domestically and internationally. Many viewed the visit as an alarming show of support for a regime widely condemned for human rights abuses. Internationally, Haider’s actions embarrassed Austria and strained relations with Western allies, while at home, the visit fueled accusations that Haider was aligning himself with authoritarian regimes for political gain. The fallout from this meeting has further isolated him in the political sphere."
austria.6.o1:0 "Did that really have to happen?"
austria.7.t:0 "Jörg Haider meets Muammar al-Gaddafi!"
austria.7.d:0 "In a move that has already ignited widespread criticism, far-right politician Jörg Haider met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi today. Haider, the governor of Carinthia and former leader of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), traveled to Tripoli, claiming the visit aimed to promote economic cooperation and strengthen ties between Austria and Libya. However, the meeting, which took place amid Gaddafi's continued isolation from Western nations due to his authoritarian rule and alleged support for terrorism, is being seen as a highly provocative gesture. Haider's praise for Gaddafi’s leadership has only fueled the backlash, with critics accusing him of legitimizing a dictator notorious for his oppressive regime. The diplomatic fallout is expected to be significant, with Haider once again distancing himself from Austria’s mainstream politics."
austria.7.o1:0 "A hit against Haider."
austria.8.t:0 "Death of Jörg Haider"
austria.8.d:0 "Jörg Haider, the controversial far-right politician, died in a car crash early this morning. He was 58 years old. Haider, governor of the southern state of Carinthia and leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), was driving alone when his car veered off the road near Klagenfurt, reportedly traveling at high speed. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Haider was a polarizing figure in Austrian politics for decades, known for his hardline anti-immigration stance and criticism of the European Union. His career was marked by sharp controversy, with many condemning his praise of aspects of Nazi-era policies, while others supported his nationalist and populist positions. In recent years, he had worked to soften his image, but his influence on the far-right movements remained strong. The news has shocked Austria, where Haider had both ardent supporters and fierce critics. The chancellor expressed condolences to Haider's family, calling the accident "a tragic event." Despite his divisive views, Haider was a dominant figure in Austrian politics, making his sudden death a significant moment for the country. An investigation into the cause of the crash is underway."
austria.8.o1:0 "Rest in Peace."
