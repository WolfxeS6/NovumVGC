Key figures in the party emphasize the need for a robust response to neoliberal policies and austerity measures, advocating for greater social welfare and equitable economic policies. The WASG's platform focuses on improving labor conditions, increasing social security, and promoting fair wages. The party's founders believe that their mission resonates with a growing segment of the population seeking more comprehensive social justice and economic reforms.

 GER_focus_on_africa_desc:0 "Africa was under-appreciated by Germany ever since the colonial empire was dissolved in 1918.

 GER_peace_first:0 "Peace First"

 GER_revenge_for_stalingrad_desc:0 "Stalingrad was the end of our great reich. We lost a million good men in that cauldron and only 6,000 ever returned home. Stalingrad is a national disgrace the likes of which we only saw at Versailles. It is time to finally take Volgograd for the German people. And we should probably take Moscow as well.
