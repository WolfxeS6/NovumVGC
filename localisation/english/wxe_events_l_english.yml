news.835.d:0 "The Russian Civil War takes another dramatic turn as the Chechen forces, who had initially risen against both the communist and federal factions, have struck a deal with the Russian federal government. After months of fierce fighting against all sides, the Chechen leadership has chosen to align with the federalists, securing promises of autonomy and other concessions in exchange for their support against the resurgent Soviet forces. This unexpected alliance has shifted the balance of power, as federal troops are now bolstered by battle-hardened Chechen fighters with intimate knowledge of the region.\n\n The move has angered the Soviet side, which had hoped the Chechens’ resistance would weaken the federal government’s grip. Instead, this new partnership solidifies the federalists’ position in key contested areas, posing a greater challenge to communist forces pushing toward Moscow. The deal between the Chechens and the federal government stands as a stark reminder of the complexities of this war, where shifting alliances and competing interests shape the course of the struggle for Russia’s future."

news.836.d:0 "The Russian Civil War ended with the victory of the Communist Soviets. The UCF (United Communist Front) was able to organize a new state in a short time and repel internal counter-revolution and foreign invaders.\n\nDespite the victory, the balance of forces in the ruling communist coalition is unstable. During the war, the unity of the UCF rested on the fight against a common enemy. Now the Coalition may break up and no one can predict the result of such a development of events.\n\nOne thing is clear, no matter who comes to power in Soviet Russia in the near future, the situation in the region and throughout the post-Soviet countries will remain tense."

news.837.d:0 "The civil war in Russia ended with the victory of the federal government, which was overthrown by the neo-Bolsheviks several years ago.\n\nAs a result of the conflict, Russia lost a lot of territory, and its economic potential dropped dramatically. The new old government will have to pay debts to foreign powers and their mercenaries for a long time for their help in defeating the communists, without which, probably, the victory over the Soviets would have been impossible. The federal government also has to centralize the country, which during the war turned into some kind of warlord-era China. Apparently, this conflict was profitable only for foreign states, which turned Russia into their semi-colony with a system of enslaving treaties."

In a bold move, Chechen forces have risen up, seizing the moment to challenge the federal government's authority. The chaos of the civil war between the communist Soviet revivalists and the federal government has created a power vacuum, and the Chechen insurgents are exploiting the disarray to push for independence. The conflict threatens to further destabilize the region as Moscow struggles to regain control, while the Soviet communists watch closely, potentially ready to capitalize on the turmoil. The situation remains volatile, with far-reaching implications for the future of the Caucasus and beyond."
