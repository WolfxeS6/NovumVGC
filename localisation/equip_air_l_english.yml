The design was based on the F-111A model but included longer wings and strengthened undercarriage. The Australian government ordered 24 F-111Cs to equip the RAAF in 1963, but the aircraft were not delivered until 1973 because of long-running technical problems."

With the introduction of the B-1B Lancer, the USAF had no need for the FB-111, and it was reconfigured back into a tactical role and renamed the F-111G.

With the introduction of the B-21 in the US arsenal, Australia was able to procure older B-2s to fill the long-held gap of strategic bombers. While RAAF doctrine has had little use for strategic-level attacks, the allure of an aircraft with still-viable stealth technology was too valuable to pass up."
